{"title": null, "content": "\n\n\n  (baptised 17 December 1770 – 26 March 1827) was a German composer and pianist. He is one of the most revered figures in the history of Western music; his works rank among the most performed of the   repertoire and span the   from the   to the   era in classical music. Beethoven's career has conventionally been divided into early, middle, and late periods. His early period, during which he forged his craft, is typically considered to have lasted until 1802. From 1802 to around 1812, his middle period showed an individual development from the styles of   and  , and is sometimes characterized as heroic. During this time, he began to grow increasingly  . In his late period, from 1812 to 1827, he extended his innovations in musical form and expression.\n Born in  , Beethoven displayed his musical talent at a young age. He was initially taught intensively by his father,  , and later by  . Under Neefe's tutelage in 1783, he published his first work, a set of keyboard variations. He found relief from a dysfunctional home life with the family of  , whose children he loved, befriended, and taught piano. At age 21, he moved to  , which subsequently became his base, and studied composition with Haydn. Beethoven then gained a reputation as a virtuoso pianist, and was soon patronised by   for compositions, which resulted in his three     (the earliest works to which he accorded an  ) in 1795.\n His first major orchestral work, the  , premiered in 1800, and his   was published in 1801. Despite his hearing deteriorating during this period, he continued to conduct, premiering his   and   in 1804 and 1808, respectively. His   appeared in 1806. His   (No. 5, Op. 73, known as the  ), dedicated to his frequent patron  , premiered in 1811, without Beethoven as soloist. He was almost completely deaf by 1814, and he then gave up performing and appearing in public. He described his problems with health and his unfulfilled personal life in two letters, his   (1802) to his brothers and his unsent love letter to an unknown \" \" (1812).\n After 1810, increasingly less socially involved, Beethoven composed many of his most admired works, including later symphonies, mature   and the  . His only opera,  , first performed in 1805, was revised to its final version in 1814. He composed   between 1819 and 1823 and his final Symphony,  , one of the first examples of a  , between 1822 and 1824. Written in his last years, his  , including the  , of 1825–1826 are among his final achievements. After several months of illness, which left him bedridden, he  .\n Beethoven was the grandson of  ,  a musician from the town of   in the Austrian   in what is now the   of  , who moved to   at the age of 21.  Ludwig was employed as a   singer at the court of  ,  , eventually rising to become, in 1761,   (music director) and hence a preeminent musician in Bonn. The portrait he commissioned of himself toward the end of his life remained displayed in his grandson's rooms as a talisman of his musical heritage.  Ludwig had two sons, the younger of whom,  , worked as a tenor in the same musical establishment and gave keyboard and   lessons to supplement his income. \n Johann married   in 1767; she was the daughter of Heinrich Keverich (1701–1751), who was head chef at the court of  ,  .  Beethoven was born of this marriage in Bonn, at what is now the   Museum, Bonngasse 20.  There is no authentic record of the date of his birth; but the registry of his  , in the   Parish of St. Remigius on 17 December 1770, survives, and the custom in the region at the time was to carry out baptism within 24 hours of birth. There is a consensus (with which Beethoven himself agreed) that his birth date was 16 December, but no documentary proof of this. \n Of the seven children born to Johann van Beethoven, only Ludwig, the second-born, and two younger brothers survived infancy.   (generally known as Karl) was born on 8 April 1774, and  , who was generally known as Johann, the youngest, was born on 2 October 1776. \n Beethoven's first music teacher was his father. He later had other local teachers, including the court   Gilles van den Eeden (d. 1782), Tobias Friedrich Pfeiffer, a family friend, who provided keyboard tuition, Franz Rovantini, a relative who instructed him in playing the violin and  ,  and court concertmaster  , who instructed Beethoven on the violin.  His tuition began in his fifth year. The regime was harsh and intensive, often reducing him to tears. With the involvement of Pfeiffer, who was an  , there were irregular late-night sessions with the young Beethoven dragged from his bed to the keyboard.  Beethoven's musical talent became obvious at a young age. Aware of  's successes in this area with his son   and daughter  , Johann attempted to promote his son as a  , claiming that Beethoven was six (he was seven) on the posters for his first public performance in March 1778. \n In 1780 or 1781, Beethoven began his studies with his most important teacher in Bonn,  .  Neefe taught him composition; in March 1783, Beethoven's first published work appeared, a set of keyboard variations (  63).  Beethoven soon began working with Neefe as assistant organist, at first unpaid (1782), and then as a paid employee (1784) of the court chapel.  His  , WoO 47, sometimes known as   (Elector) for their dedication to Elector  , were published in 1783.  In the same year, the first printed reference to Beethoven appeared in the   – \"Louis van Beethoven [sic] ... a boy of 11 years and most promising talent. He plays the piano very skilfully and with power, reads at sight very well ... the chief piece he plays is   of  , which Herr Neefe puts into his hands\".  Maximilian Friedrich's successor as Elector of Bonn was  . He gave some support to Beethoven, appointing him Court Organist and assisting financially with Beethoven's move to Vienna in 1792. \n During this time, Beethoven met several people who became important in his life. He developed a close relationship with the upper class   family, and gave piano lessons to some of the children. The widowed   became a \"second mother\" to Beethoven, taught him more refined manners and nurtured his passion for literature and poetry. The warmth and closeness of the von Breuning family offered the young Beethoven a retreat from his unhappy home life, dominated by his father's decline due to alcoholism. Beethoven also met  , a young medical student, who became a lifelong friend and married one of the von Breuning daughters. Another frequenter of the von Breunings was  , who became a friend and financial supporter to Beethoven during this period.  In 1791, Waldstein commissioned Beethoven's first work for the stage, the ballet   (WoO 1). \n The period of 1785 to 1790 includes virtually no record of Beethoven's activity as a composer. This may be attributed to the varied response his initial publications attracted, and also to ongoing issues in his family.  While passing through  , Beethoven visited with composer   and her husband, who gave him money to return to Bonn to be with his ailing mother.  Beethoven's mother died in July 1787, shortly after his return from Vienna, where he stayed for around two weeks and possibly met Mozart.  In 1789, due to his chronic alcoholism, Beethoven's father was forced to retire from the service of the Court and it was ordered that half of his father's pension be paid directly to Ludwig for support of the family.  Ludwig contributed further to the family's income by teaching (to which Wegeler said he had \"an extraordinary aversion\" ) and by playing   in the court orchestra. This familiarised him with a variety of operas, including works by Mozart,   and  .  There he also befriended  , a composer, flutist, and violinist of about his own age who was a nephew of the court orchestra's conductor,  . \n From 1790 to 1792, Beethoven composed several works, none of which were published at the time; they showed a growing range and maturity.   have identified a theme similar to those of his   in a set of variations written in 1791.  It was perhaps on Neefe's recommendation that Beethoven received his first commissions; the Literary Society in Bonn commissioned a cantata to mark the recent death of   (WoO 87), and a further cantata, to celebrate the subsequent accession of   as   (WoO 88), may have been commissioned by the Elector.  These two   were not performed during Beethoven's lifetime and became lost until the 1880s, when   called them \"Beethoven through and through\" and of the style that marked Beethoven's music distinct from the classical tradition. \n Beethoven probably was first introduced to   in late 1790, when Haydn was travelling to London and made a brief stop in Bonn around Christmastime.  In July 1792, they met again in Bonn on Haydn's return trip from London to Vienna, when Beethoven played in the orchestra at the  . Arrangements were likely made at that time for Beethoven to study with Haydn.  Waldstein wrote to Beethoven before his departure: \"You are going to Vienna in fulfilment of your long-frustrated wishes ... With the help of assiduous labour you shall receive Mozart's spirit from Haydn's hands.\" \n Beethoven left   for   in November 1792 amid rumours of  . Shortly after departing, Beethoven learned that his father had died.  Over the next few years, he responded to the widespread feeling that he was a successor to the recently deceased Mozart by studying Mozart's work and writing works with a distinctly Mozartian flavour. \n Beethoven did not immediately set out to establish himself as a composer, but rather devoted himself to study and performance. Working under Haydn's direction,  he sought to master  . He also studied violin under  .  Early in this period, he also began receiving occasional instruction from  , primarily in Italian vocal composition style; this relationship persisted until at least 1802, and possibly as late as 1809. \n With Haydn's departure for England in 1794, Beethoven was expected by the Elector to return home to Bonn. He chose instead to remain in Vienna, continuing his instruction in counterpoint with   and other teachers. In any case, by this time it must have seemed clear to his employer that Bonn would fall to the French, as it did in October 1794, effectively leaving Beethoven without a stipend or the necessity to return.  But several Viennese noblemen had already recognised his ability and offered him financial support, among them  ,  , and Baron  . \n Assisted by his connections with Haydn and Waldstein, Beethoven began to develop a reputation as a performer and improviser in the salons of the Viennese nobility.  His friend   began publishing his compositions, starting with a set of keyboard variations on a theme of   (WoO 66).  By 1793, he had established a reputation in Vienna as a piano virtuoso, but he apparently withheld works from publication so that their eventual appearance would have greater impact. \n In 1795, Beethoven made his public debut in Vienna over three days,  beginning with a performance of one of his own   on 29 March at the   and ending with a Mozart concerto on 31 March, probably the  , for which he had written a   soon after his arrival in Vienna. By this year he had two piano concertos available for performance, one in   he had begun composing before moving to Vienna and had worked on for over a decade, and one in   composed for the most part during 1795.  Viewing the latter as the more substantive work, he chose to designate it his  , publishing it in March 1801 as Opus 15, before publishing the former as   the following December. He wrote new cadenzas for both in 1809. \n Shortly after his public debut, Beethoven arranged for the publication of the first of his compositions to which he assigned an  , the  . These works were dedicated to his patron Prince Lichnowsky,  and were a financial success; Beethoven's profits were nearly sufficient to cover his living expenses for a year.  In 1799, Beethoven participated in (and won) a notorious piano 'duel' at the home of Baron Raimund Wetzlar (a former patron of Mozart) against the virtuoso  ; and the next year he similarly triumphed against   at the salon of  .  Beethoven's eighth piano sonata, the   (Op. 13, published in 1799), is described by the musicologist   as \"surpass[ing] any of his previous compositions, in strength of character, depth of emotion, level of originality, and ingenuity of motivic and tonal manipulation\". \n Between 1798 and 1800, Beethoven composed his   (commissioned by, and dedicated to, Prince Lobkowitz), published in 1801. He also completed his   (Op. 20) in 1799, a work which was extremely popular during Beethoven's lifetime. With premieres of his   and   Symphonies in 1800 and 1803, Beethoven became regarded as one of the most important of a generation of young composers following Haydn and Mozart. But his melodies, musical development, use of modulation and texture, and characterisation of emotion all set him apart from his influences, and heightened the impact some of his early works made when they were first published.  For the premiere of his First Symphony, he hired the   on 2 April 1800, and staged an extensive programme, including works by Haydn and Mozart, as well as his Septet, the Symphony, and one of his piano concertos (the latter three works all then unpublished). The concert, which the   called \"the most interesting concert in a long time\", was not without difficulties; among the criticisms was that \"the players did not bother to pay any attention to the soloist\".  By the end of 1800, Beethoven and his music were already much in demand from patrons and publishers. \n In May 1799, Beethoven taught piano to the daughters of Hungarian Countess Anna Brunsvik. During this time, he fell in love with the younger daughter,  . Among his other students, from 1801 to 1805, he tutored  , who went on to become a composer and later wrote about their encounters. The young  , who later became a renowned pianist and music teacher himself, studied with Beethoven from 1801 to 1803. In late 1801, Beethoven met a young countess,  , through the Brunsvik family; he mentions his love for Julie in a November 1801 letter to a friend, but class difference prevented any consideration of pursuing it. He dedicated his 1802  , now commonly known as the  , to her. \n In the spring of 1801, Beethoven completed a  ,   (op. 43). The work received numerous performances in 1801 and 1802 and he rushed to publish a piano arrangement to capitalise on its early popularity.  Beethoven completed his   in 1802, intended for performance at a concert that was cancelled. The symphony received its premiere one year later, at a subscription concert in April, 1803 at the  , where Beethoven had been appointed composer in residence. In addition to the Second Symphony, the concert also featured the First Symphony, the  , and the    . Reviews of the concert were mixed, but it was a financial success; Beethoven was able to charge three times the cost of a typical concert ticket. \n In 1802, Beethoven's brother Kaspar began to assist the composer in handling his affairs, particularly his business dealings with music publishers. In addition to successfully negotiating higher payments for Beethoven's latest works, Kaspar also began selling several of Beethoven's earlier unpublished compositions and encouraged his brother (against Beethoven's preference) to make arrangements and transcriptions of his more popular works for other instruments and combinations. Beethoven decided to accede to these requests, as he was powerless to prevent publishers from hiring others to do similar arrangements of his works. \n Beethoven told the English pianist   (in 1815) that his hearing loss began in 1798, during a heated quarrel with a singer.  During its gradual decline, his hearing was further impeded by a severe form of  .  As early as 1801, he wrote to Wegeler and another friend, Karl Amenda, describing his symptoms and the difficulties they caused in both professional and social settings (although it is likely some of his close friends were already aware of the issues).  The cause was probably  , possibly accompanied by degeneration of the  . \n On his doctor's advice, Beethoven moved to the small Austrian town of  , just outside Vienna, from April to October 1802 in an attempt to come to terms with his condition. There he wrote the document now known as the  , a letter to his brothers that records his thoughts of suicide due to his growing deafness and his resolution to continue living for and through his art. The letter was never sent and was discovered in his papers after his death.  The letters to Wegeler and Amenda were not so despairing; in them Beethoven commented also on his ongoing professional and financial success at this period, and his determination, as he expressed it to Wegeler, to \"seize Fate by the throat; it shall certainly not crush me completely\".  In 1806, Beethoven noted on one of his musical sketches: \"Let your deafness no longer be a secret—even in art.\" \n Beethoven's hearing loss did not prevent him from composing music, but it made playing at concerts—an important source of income at this phase of his life—increasingly difficult. It also contributed substantially to his social withdrawal.  Czerny remarked that Beethoven could still hear speech and music normally until 1812.  Beethoven never became totally deaf; in his final years he was still able to distinguish low tones and sudden loud sounds. \n Beethoven's return to   from Heiligenstadt was marked by a change in musical style, and is now often designated as the start of his middle or \"heroic\" period, characterised by many original works composed on a grand scale.  According to Czerny, Beethoven said: \"I am not satisfied with the work I have done so far. From now on I intend to take a new way.\"  An early major work employing this new style was the   in E-flat, Op. 55, known as the  , written in 1803–04. The idea of creating a symphony based on the career of   may have been suggested to Beethoven by   in 1798.  Sympathetic to the ideal of the heroic revolutionary leader, Beethoven originally gave the symphony the title \"Bonaparte\", but disillusioned by Napoleon  , he scratched Napoleon's name from the manuscript's title page, and the symphony was published in 1806 with its present title and the subtitle \"to celebrate the memory of a great man\".  The   was longer and larger in scope than any previous symphony. When it premiered in early 1805 it received a mixed reception. Some listeners objected to its length or disliked its structure, while others viewed it as a masterpiece. \n Other middle-period works extend in the same dramatic manner the musical language Beethoven had inherited. The   string quartets and the   and   piano sonatas share the Third Symphony's heroic spirit.  Other works of this period include the   through   Symphonies, the oratorio  , the opera  , and the  .  Beethoven was hailed in 1810 by the writer and composer  , in an influential review in the  , as the greatest of (what he considered) the three   composers (that is, ahead of Haydn and Mozart); in Beethoven's   his music, wrote Hoffmann, \"sets in motion terror, fear, horror, pain, and awakens the infinite yearning that is the essence of romanticism\". \n During this time, Beethoven's income came from publishing his works, from performances of them, and from his patrons, for whom he gave private performances and copies of works they commissioned for an exclusive period before their publication. Some of his early patrons, including Lobkowitz and Lichnowsky, gave him annual stipends in addition to commissioning works and purchasing published works.  Perhaps his most important aristocratic patron was  , the youngest son of  , who in 1803 or 1804 began to study piano and composition with him. They became friends, and their meetings continued until 1824.  Beethoven dedicated 14 compositions to Rudolf, including such major works as the   Op. 97 (1811) and   Op. 123 (1823).\n His position at the Theater an der Wien was terminated when the theatre changed management in early 1804, and he was forced to move temporarily to the suburbs of Vienna with his friend Stephan von Breuning. This slowed work on   (his original title for his opera), his largest work to date, for a time. It was delayed again by the Austrian   and finally premiered, under its present title of  , in November 1805 to houses that were nearly empty because of the  . In addition to being a financial failure, this version of   was also a critical failure, and Beethoven began revising it. \n Despite this failure, Beethoven continued to attract recognition. In 1807 the musician and publisher   secured the rights to publish his works in England, and Haydn's former patron   commissioned the  , Op. 86, for his wife's name-day. But he could not count on such recognition alone. A   he organized in December 1808, widely advertised, included the premieres of the Fifth and   symphonies, the  , extracts from the Mass in C, the     Op. 65 and the  . There was a large audience (including Czerny and the young  ), but it was under-rehearsed, involved many stops and starts, and during the Fantasia Beethoven was noted shouting at the musicians \"badly played, wrong, again!\" The financial outcome is unknown. \n In the autumn of 1808, after having been rejected for a position at the Royal Theatre, Beethoven received an offer from Napoleon's brother  , then king of  , for a well-paid position as   at the court in  . To persuade him to stay in Vienna, Archduke Rudolf,   and Prince Lobkowitz, after receiving representations from Beethoven's friends, pledged to pay him a pension of 4000 florins a year.  In the event, Rudolf paid his share of the pension on the agreed date.  Kinsky, immediately called to military duty, did not contribute and died in November 1812 after falling from his horse.  The Austrian currency destabilized and Lobkowitz went bankrupt in 1811 so that to benefit from the agreement Beethoven eventually had recourse to the law, which in 1815 brought him some recompense. \n The   reaching Vienna itself was felt in early 1809. In April, Beethoven completed writing his   in E-flat major, Op. 73,  which the musicologist   has called \"the apotheosis of the military concept\" in Beethoven's music.  Rudolf left the capital with the Imperial family in early May, prompting Beethoven's piano sonata   (Sonata No. 26, Op. 81a), actually titled by Beethoven in German   (The Farewell), of which the final movement,   (The Return), is dated in the manuscript with the date of Rudolf's homecoming of 30 January 1810.  During the French bombardment of Vienna in May, Beethoven took refuge in the cellar of his brother Kaspar's house.  The subsequent occupation of Vienna and disruptions to cultural life and to Beethoven's publishers, together with Beethoven's poor health at the end of 1809, explain his significantly reduced output during this period,  although other notable works of the year include his   in E-flat major, Op. 74 ( ) and the   in F-sharp major, Op. 78, dedicated to Josephine's sister  . \n At the end of 1809, Beethoven was commissioned to write incidental music for  's play  .   (an overture, and nine additional   and vocal pieces, Op. 84), which appeared in 1810, fit well with Beethoven's heroic style and he became interested in Goethe, setting three of his poems as songs (Op. 83) and learning about him from a mutual acquaintance,   (who also wrote to Goethe at this time about Beethoven). Other works of this period in a similar vein were the F minor  , to which Beethoven gave the subtitle  , and the Op. 97   known, from its dedication to his patron Rudolph, as the  . \n In the spring of 1811, Beethoven became seriously ill, with headaches and high fever. His doctor   recommended he take a cure at the   of   (now Teplice in the  ), where he wrote two more overtures and sets of incidental music for dramas, this time by   –   Op. 117 and   Op. 113. Advised again to visit Teplitz in 1812, he met there with Goethe, who wrote: \"His talent amazed me; unfortunately he is an utterly untamed personality, who is not altogether wrong in holding the world to be detestable, but surely does not make it any more enjoyable ... by his attitude.\" Beethoven wrote to his publishers  , \"Goethe delights far too much in the court atmosphere, far more than is becoming in a poet.\"  But following their meeting he began a setting for choir and orchestra of    , Op. 112, completed in 1815. After it was published in 1822 with a dedication to the poet, Beethoven wrote to him: \"The admiration, the love and esteem which already in my youth I cherished for the one and only immortal Goethe have persisted.\" \n While Beethoven was at Teplitz in 1812, he wrote a ten-page love letter to his \" \", which he never sent to its addressee.  The identity of the intended recipient was long a subject of debate, although the musicologist   has argued that the intended recipient was  ; other candidates included Julie Guicciardi,   and Josephine Brunsvik. \n All of these had been regarded by Beethoven as possible soulmates during his first decade in Vienna. Guicciardi, although she flirted with Beethoven, never had any serious interest in him and married   in November 1803. (Beethoven insisted to his later secretary and biographer,  , that Guicciardi had \"sought me out, crying, but I scorned her\".)  Josephine had, since Beethoven's initial infatuation with her, married the elderly Count Joseph Deym, who died in 1804. Beethoven began to visit her and commenced a passionate correspondence. Initially, he accepted that Josephine could not love him, but he continued to address himself to her even after she had moved to Budapest, finally demonstrating that he had got the message in his last letter to her of 1807: \"I thank you for wishing still to appear as if I were not altogether banished from your memory\".  Malfatti was the niece of Beethoven's doctor, and he had proposed to her in 1810. He was 40, and she was 19. The proposal was rejected.  She is now remembered as the recipient of the piano    . \n Antonie (Toni) Brentano (née von Birkenstock), ten years younger than Beethoven, was the wife of Franz Brentano, the half-brother of  , who provided Beethoven's introduction to the family. It would seem that Antonie and Beethoven had an affair during 1811–1812. Antonie left Vienna with her husband in late 1812 and never met with (or apparently corresponded with) Beethoven again, although in her later years she wrote and spoke fondly of him.  Some speculate that Beethoven was the father of Antonie's son Karl Josef, though the two never met. \n After 1812 there are no reports of any romantic liaisons of Beethoven's; however, it is clear from his correspondence of the period and, later, from the conversation books, that he occasionally had sex with prostitutes. \n In early 1813, Beethoven apparently went through a difficult emotional period, and his compositional output dropped. His personal appearance degraded—it had generally been neat—as did his manners in public, notably when dining. \n Family issues may have played a part in this. Beethoven had visited his brother Johann at the end of October 1812. He wished to end Johann's cohabitation with Therese Obermayer, a woman who already had an illegitimate child. He was unable to convince Johann to end the relationship and appealed to the local civic and religious authorities, but Johann and Therese married on 8 November. \n The illness and eventual death of his brother Kaspar from   became an increasing concern. Kaspar had been ill for some time; in 1813 Beethoven lent him 1500  , to procure the repayment of which he was ultimately led to complex legal measures.  After Kaspar died on 15 November 1815, Beethoven immediately became embroiled in a protracted legal dispute with Kaspar's widow   over custody of their son  , then nine years old. Beethoven had successfully applied to Kaspar to have himself named the sole guardian of the boy. A late   to Kaspar's will gave him and Johanna joint guardianship.  While Beethoven was successful at having his nephew removed from her custody in January 1816, and had him removed to a private school,  in 1818 he was again preoccupied with the legal processes around Karl. While giving evidence to the court for the  , the  , Beethoven was unable to prove that he was of noble birth and as a consequence, on 18 December 1818 the case was transferred to the civil   of Vienna, where he lost sole guardianship.  He regained custody after intensive legal struggles in 1820.  During the years that followed, Beethoven frequently interfered in his nephew's life in what Karl perceived as an overbearing manner. \n Beethoven was finally motivated to begin significant composition again in June 1813 when news arrived of the French defeat at the   by a coalition led by the  . The inventor   persuaded him to write a work commemorating the event for his mechanical instrument the  . This Beethoven also transcribed for orchestra as   (Op. 91, also known as the  ).  It was first performed on 8 December, along with his  , Op. 92, at a charity concert for victims of the war, a concert whose success led to its repeat on 12 December. The orchestra included several leading and rising musicians who happened to be in Vienna at the time, including   and  .  The work received repeat performances at concerts staged by Beethoven in January and February 1814.  These concerts brought Beethoven more profit than any others in his career, and enabled him to buy the bank shares that were the most valuable assets in his estate at his death. \n Beethoven's renewed popularity led to demands for a revival of  , which, in its third revised version, was also well received at its July opening in Vienna, and was frequently staged there during the following years.  Beethoven's publisher,  , commissioned the 20-year-old Moscheles to prepare a piano score of the opera, which he inscribed \"Finished, with God's help!\"—to which Beethoven added \"O Man, help thyself.\"  That summer Beethoven composed a piano sonata for the first time in five years, his  .  He was also one of many composers who produced music in a patriotic vein to entertain the many heads of state and diplomats who came to the   that began in November 1814, with the cantata   (Op. 136) and similar choral works which, in the words of Maynard Solomon, \"broadened Beethoven's popularity, [but] did little to enhance his reputation as a serious composer\". \n In April and May 1814, playing in his   Trio, Beethoven made his last public appearances as a soloist. The composer   noted: \"the piano was badly out of tune, which Beethoven minded little, since he did not hear it ... there was scarcely anything left of the virtuosity of the artist ... I was deeply saddened.\"  From 1814 onward Beethoven used for conversation   designed by   (a number of these are on display at the Beethoven-Haus in Bonn). \n His 1815 compositions include an expressive second setting of the poem   (Op. 94) in 1815. Compared to its first setting in 1805 (a gift for Josephine Brunsvik), it was \"far more dramatic ... The entire spirit is that of an operatic scena.\"  But his energy seemed to be dropping: apart from these works, he wrote the two  , and a few minor pieces, and began but abandoned a sixth piano concerto. \n Between 1815 and 1819, Beethoven's output dropped again to a level unique in his mature life.  He attributed part of this to a lengthy illness that he called an inflammatory fever that he had for more than a year starting in October 1816.  Solomon suggests it is also doubtless a consequence of the ongoing legal problems concerning his nephew Karl,  and of Beethoven finding himself increasingly at odds with current musical trends. Unsympathetic to developments in German romanticism that featured the supernatural (as in operas by Spohr,   and  ), he also \"resisted the impending Romantic fragmentation of the ... cyclic forms of the Classical era into small forms and lyric mood pieces\" and turned towards study of Bach,   and  .  An old connection was renewed in 1817 when Maelzel sought, and obtained, Beethoven's endorsement for his newly developed  .  During these years the few major works he completed include the 1818   (Sonata No. 29 in B-flat major, Op. 106) and his settings of poems by  ,   Op. 98 (1816), which introduced the   into classical repertoire.  In 1818 he began musical sketches that eventually formed part of his Ninth Symphony. \n By early 1818 Beethoven's health had improved, and his nephew Karl, now aged 11, moved in with him in January (although within a year Karl's mother had won him back in the courts).  By now Beethoven's hearing had again seriously deteriorated, necessitating that he and his interlocutors write in notebooks to carry out conversations. These 'conversation books' are a rich written resource for his life from this period onward. They contain discussions about music, business, and personal life; they are also a valuable source for his contacts and for investigations into how he intended his music should be performed, and of his opinions of the art of music.    His household management had also improved somewhat with the help of  . A proprietor of the Stein piano workshop and a personal friend, Streicher had assisted in Beethoven's care during his illness; she continued to provide some support, and in her he finally found a skilled cook.  A testimonial to the esteem in which Beethoven was held in England was the presentation to him in this year by Thomas Broadwood, the proprietor of the company, of a  , for which Beethoven expressed thanks. He was not well enough, however, to carry out a visit to London that year which had been proposed by the  . \n Despite the time occupied by his ongoing legal struggles over Karl, which involved continuing extensive correspondence and lobbying,  two events sparked off Beethoven's major composition projects in 1819. The first was the announcement of Archduke Rudolf's promotion to  -  as Archbishop of   (now in the Czech Republic), which triggered the   Op. 123, intended to be ready for his installation in Olomouc in March 1820. The other was the invitation by the publisher   to 50 Viennese composers, including Beethoven,  , Czerny and the 8-year-old  , to compose a variation each on a theme which he provided. Beethoven was spurred to outdo the competition and by mid-1819 had already completed 20 variations of what were to become the 33   op. 120. Neither of these works was completed for a few years.  A significant tribute of 1819, however, was Archduke Rudolf's set of 40 piano variations on a theme written for him by Beethoven (WoO 200) and dedicated to the master.  Beethoven's portrait by   of this year, which was one of the most familiar images of him for the next century, was described by Schindler as, despite its artistic weaknesses, \"in the rendering of that particular look, the majestic forehead ... the firmly shut mouth and the chin shaped like a shell, ... truer to nature than any other picture\".    also created  . \n Beethoven's determination over the following years to write the   for Rudolf was not motivated by any devout  . Although he had been born a Catholic, the form of religion as practised at the court in Bonn where he grew up was, in the words of Solomon, \"a compromise ideology that permitted a relatively peaceful coexistence between the Church and  \".  Beethoven's   (a diary he kept on an occasional basis between 1812 and 1818) shows his interest in a variety of religious philosophies, including those of India, Egypt and the Orient and the writings of the  .  In a letter to Rudolf of July 1821, Beethoven shows his belief in a personal God: \"God ... sees into my innermost heart and knows that as a man I perform most conscientiously and on all occasions the duties which Humanity, God, and Nature enjoin upon me.\" On one of the sketches for the   he wrote \"Plea for inner and outer peace\". \n Beethoven's status was confirmed by the series of   given in Vienna by the choirmaster Franz Xaver Gebauer in the 1819/1820 and 1820/1821 seasons, during which all eight of his symphonies to date, plus the oratorio   and the Mass in C, were performed. Beethoven was typically underwhelmed: when in an April 1820 conversation book a friend mentioned Gebauer, Beethoven wrote in reply \"Geh! Bauer\" (Begone, peasant!) \n In 1819, Beethoven was first approached by the publisher  , who won the suspicious composer round, while visiting him at  , by procuring for him a plate of roast veal.  One consequence of this was that Schlesinger secured Beethoven's three last piano sonatas and his final quartets; part of the attraction to Beethoven was that Schlesinger had publishing facilities in Germany and France, and connections in England, which could overcome problems of copyright piracy.  The first of the three sonatas, for which Beethoven contracted with Schlesinger in 1820 at 30   per sonata (further delaying completion of the Mass), was sent to the publisher at the end of that year (the  , dedicated to Maximiliane, Antonie Brentano's daughter). \n In early 1821, Beethoven was once again in poor health with   and  . Despite this he continued work on the remaining piano sonatas he had promised to Schlesinger (the   was published in December), and on the Mass.  In early 1822 Beethoven sought a reconciliation with his brother Johann, whose marriage in 1812 had met with his disapproval, and Johann now became a regular visitor (as witnessed by the conversation books of the period) and began to assist him in his business affairs, including lending him money against ownership of some of his compositions. He also sought some reconciliation with the mother of his nephew, including supporting her income, although this did not meet with the approval of the contrary Karl.  Two commissions at the end of 1822 improved Beethoven's financial prospects. In November the   of London offered a commission for a symphony, which he accepted with delight, as an appropriate home for the Ninth Symphony on which he was working.  Also in November Prince   of   offered to pay Beethoven's asking price for three string quartets. Beethoven set the price at the high level of 50 ducats per quartet in a letter dictated to his nephew Karl, who was then living with him. \n During 1822, Anton Schindler, who in 1840 became one of Beethoven's earliest and most influential (but not always reliable) biographers, began to work as the composer's unpaid secretary. He later claimed that he had been a member of Beethoven's circle since 1814, but there is no evidence for this. Cooper suggests that \"Beethoven greatly appreciated his assistance, but did not think much of him as a man\". \n The year 1823 saw the completion of three notable works, all of which had occupied Beethoven for some years: the  , the Ninth Symphony and the  . \n Beethoven at last presented the manuscript of the completed   to Rudolph on 19 March (more than a year after the archduke's enthronement as archbishop). But he was in no hurry to get it published or performed as he had formed a notion that he could profitably sell manuscripts of the work to various courts in Germany and Europe at 50 ducats each. One of the few who took up this offer was   of France, who also sent Beethoven a heavy gold medallion.  The Symphony and the variations took up most of the rest of Beethoven's working year. Diabelli hoped to publish both works, but the potential prize of the Mass excited many other publishers to lobby Beethoven for it, including Schlesinger and  . (In the end, it was obtained by  ). \n \nBeethoven had become critical of the Viennese reception of his works. He told the visiting   in 1822: You will hear nothing of me here ...  ? They cannot give it, nor do they want to listen to it. The symphonies? They have no time for them. My concertos? Everyone grinds out only the stuff he himself has made. The solo pieces? They went out of fashion long ago, and here fashion is everything. At the most,   occasionally digs up a quartet.  He therefore enquired about premiering the   and the Ninth Symphony in Berlin. When his Viennese admirers learnt of this, they pleaded with him to arrange local performances. Beethoven was won over, and the symphony was first performed, along with sections of the  , on 7 May 1824, to great acclaim at the  .  Beethoven stood by the conductor   during the concert beating time (although Umlauf had warned the singers and orchestra to ignore him), and because of his deafness was not even aware of the applause which followed until he was turned to witness it.  The   gushed, \"inexhaustible genius had shown us a new world\", and Carl Czerny wrote that the Symphony \"breathes such a fresh, lively, indeed youthful spirit ... so much power, innovation, and beauty as ever [came] from the head of this original man, although he certainly sometimes led the old wigs to shake their heads\". The concert did not net Beethoven much money, as the expenses of mounting it were very high.  A second concert on 24 May, in which the producer guaranteed him a minimum fee, was poorly attended; nephew Karl noted that \"many people [had] already gone into the country\". It was Beethoven's last public concert.  Beethoven accused Schindler of either cheating him or mismanaging the ticket receipts; this led to the replacement of Schindler as Beethoven's secretary by  , the second violinist in the  , although by 1826 Beethoven and Schindler reconciled. \n Beethoven then turned to writing the string quartets for Galitzin, despite failing health. The first of these, the   was premiered by the Schuppanzigh Quartet in March 1825. While writing the next, the  , in April 1825, he was struck by a sudden illness. Recuperating in  , he included in the quartet its slow movement to which he gave the title \"Holy song of thanks (Heiliger Dankgesang) to the Divinity, from a convalescent, in the  \".  The next quartet to be completed was the  , in B♭ major. In six movements, the last, contrapuntal movement proved very difficult for both the performers and the audience at its premiere in March 1826 (again by the Schuppanzigh Quartet). Beethoven was persuaded by the publisher  , for an additional fee, to write a new finale, and to issue the last movement as a separate work (the  , Op. 133).  Beethoven's favourite was the last of this series, the  , which he rated as his most perfect single work. \n Beethoven's relations with his nephew Karl had continued to be stormy; Beethoven's letters to him were demanding and reproachful. In August, Karl, who had been seeing his mother again against Beethoven's wishes, attempted suicide by shooting himself in the head. He survived and after discharge from hospital went to recuperate in the village of   with Beethoven and his uncle Johann. In Gneixendorf, Beethoven completed a further quartet ( ), which he sent to Schlesinger. Under the introductory slow chords in the last movement, Beethoven wrote in the manuscript \"Muss es sein?\" (Must it be?); the response, over the faster main theme of the movement, is \"Es muss sein!\" (It must be!). The whole movement is headed   (The difficult decision).  Following this in November Beethoven completed his final composition, the replacement finale for the op. 130 quartet.  Beethoven at this time was already ill and depressed;  he began to quarrel with Johann, insisting that Johann make Karl his heir, in preference to Johann's wife. \n On his return journey to   from Gneixendorf in December 1826, illness struck Beethoven again. He was attended until his death by Dr. Andreas Wawruch, who throughout December noticed symptoms including fever,   and  , with swollen limbs, coughing and breathing difficulties. Several operations were carried out to tap off the excess fluid from Beethoven's abdomen. \n Karl stayed by Beethoven's bedside during December, but left after the beginning of January to join the army at   and did not see his uncle again, although he wrote to him shortly afterwards: \"My dear father ... I am living in contentment and regret only that I am separated from you.\" Immediately following Karl's departure, Beethoven wrote a will making his nephew his sole heir.  Later in January, Beethoven was attended by Dr. Malfatti, whose treatment (recognizing the seriousness of his patient's condition) was largely centred on alcohol. As the news spread of the severity of Beethoven's condition, many old friends came to visit, including Diabelli, Schuppanzigh, Lichnowsky, Schindler, the composer   and his pupil  . Many tributes and gifts were also sent, including £100 from the Philharmonic Society in London and a case of expensive wine from Schotts.  During this period, Beethoven was almost completely bedridden despite occasional efforts to rouse himself. On 24 March, he said to Schindler and the others present \"Plaudite, amici, comoedia finita est\" (\"Applaud, friends, the comedy is over\"). Later that day, when the wine from Schotts arrived, he whispered, \"Pity – too late.\" \n Beethoven died on 26 March 1827 at the age of 56; only his friend   and a \"Frau van Beethoven\" (possibly his old enemy Johanna van Beethoven) were present. According to Hüttenbrenner, at about 5 pm there was a flash of lightning and a clap of thunder: \"Beethoven opened his eyes, lifted his right hand and looked up for several seconds with his fist clenched ... not another breath, not a heartbeat more.\"  Many visitors came to the death-bed; some locks of the dead man's hair were retained by Hüttenbrenner and Hiller, among others.  An   revealed Beethoven had significant   damage, which may have been due to his heavy alcohol consumption,  and also considerable dilation of the auditory and other related nerves. \n Beethoven's funeral procession in Vienna on 29 March 1827 was attended by an estimated 10,000 people.    and the violinist   were among the torchbearers. A funeral oration by the poet   (who would also write Schubert's epitaph) was read by the actor  .  Beethoven was buried in the   cemetery, north-west of Vienna, after a   at the church of the Holy Trinity (Dreifaltigkeitskirche) in Alserstrasse. Beethoven's remains were   for study in 1863, and moved in 1888 to Vienna's   where they were reinterred in a grave adjacent to that of Schubert. \n The historian William Drabkin notes that as early as 1818 a writer had proposed a three-period division of Beethoven's works and that such a division (albeit often adopting different dates or works to denote changes in period) eventually became a convention adopted by all of Beethoven's biographers, starting with Schindler,   and  . Later writers sought to identify sub-periods within this generally accepted structure. Its drawbacks include that it generally omits a fourth period, that is, the early years in Bonn, whose works are less often considered; and that it ignores the differential development of Beethoven's composing styles over the years for different categories of work. The piano sonatas, for example, were written throughout Beethoven's life in a progression that can be interpreted as continuous development; the symphonies do not all demonstrate linear progress; of all of the types of composition, perhaps the quartets, which seem to group themselves in three periods (Op. 18 in 1801–1802, Opp. 59, 74 and 95 in 1806–1814, and the quartets, today known as 'late', from 1824 onwards) fit this categorization most neatly. Drabkin concludes that \"now that we have lived with them so long ... as long as there are programme notes, essays written to accompany recordings, and all-Beethoven recitals, it is hard to imagine us ever giving up the notion of discrete stylistic periods.\" \n Some forty compositions, including ten very early works written by Beethoven up to 1785, survive from the years that Beethoven lived in Bonn. It has been suggested that Beethoven largely abandoned composition between 1785 and 1790, possibly as a result of negative critical reaction to his first published works. A 1784 review in  's influential   compared Beethoven's efforts to those of rank beginners.  The three early piano quartets of 1785 (WoO 36), closely modelled on violin sonatas of Mozart, show his dependency on the music of the period. Beethoven himself was not to give any of the Bonn works an opus number, save for those which he reworked for use later in his career, for example, some of the songs in his Op. 52 collection (1805) and the   reworked in Vienna in 1793 to become his  .    points out that Bonn was something of a backwater compared to Vienna; Beethoven was unlikely to be acquainted with the mature works of Haydn or Mozart, and Rosen opines that his early style was closer to that of Hummel or  .  Kernan suggests that at this stage Beethoven was not especially notable for his works in   style, but more for his vocal music; his move to Vienna in 1792 set him on the path to develop the music in the genres he became known for. \n The conventional first period begins after Beethoven's arrival in Vienna in 1792. In the first few years he seems to have composed less than he did at Bonn, and his Piano Trios, op.1 were not published until 1795. From this point onward, he had mastered the 'Viennese style' (best known today from   and  ) and was making the style his own. His works from 1795 to 1800 are larger in scale than was the norm (writing sonatas in four movements, not three, for instance); typically he uses a   rather than a  ; and his music often includes dramatic, even sometimes over-the-top, uses of extreme dynamics and tempi and chromatic harmony. It was this that led Haydn to believe the third trio of Op.1 was too difficult for an audience to appreciate. \n He also explored new directions and gradually expanded the scope and ambition of his work. Some important pieces from the early period are the   and   symphonies, the set of six string quartets  , the first two piano concertos, and the first dozen or so  , including the famous   sonata, Op. 13.\n His middle period began shortly after the personal crisis brought on by his recognition of encroaching deafness. It includes large-scale works that express heroism and struggle. Middle-period works include six symphonies (Nos. 3–8), the last two piano concertos, the   and  , five string quartets (Nos. 7–11), several piano sonatas (including the   and   sonatas), the   violin sonata and his only  ,  .\n This period is sometimes associated with a   manner of composing,  but the use of the term \"heroic\" has become increasingly controversial in Beethoven scholarship. The term is more frequently used as an alternative name for the middle period.  The appropriateness of the term heroic to describe the whole middle period has been questioned as well: while some works, like the Third and Fifth Symphonies, are easy to describe as heroic, many others, like his   or his  , are not. \n Beethoven's late period began in the decade 1810-1819.  He began a renewed study of older music, including works by  ,  , and  , whom Beethoven considered \"the greatest composer who ever lived\".  Beethoven's late works incorporated   and  -era devices.  For example, the overture   (1822) included a fugue influenced by Handel's music.  A new style emerged, as he returned to the keyboard to compose his first piano sonatas in almost a decade; the works of the late period include the last five piano sonatas and the  , the last two sonatas for cello and piano, the   (including the massive  ), and two works for very large forces: the   and the  .  Works from this period are characterised by their intellectual depth, their formal innovations, and their intense, highly personal expression. The   has seven linked movements, and the   adds choral forces to the orchestra in the last movement. \n Beethoven's earlier preferred pianos included those of  ; he may have been given a Stein piano by Count Waldstein.  From 1786 onwards there is evidence of Beethoven's cooperation with  , who had married Stein's daughter  . Streicher left Stein's business to set up his own firm in 1803, and Beethoven continued to admire his products, writing to him in 1817 of his \"special preference\" for his pianos.  Among the other pianos Beethoven possessed was an   piano given to him by the manufacturer in 1803.  The Érard piano, with its exceptional resonance, may have influenced Beethoven's piano style – shortly after receiving it he began writing his   – but despite initial enthusiasm he seems to have abandoned it before 1810, when he wrote that it was \"simply not of any use any more\"; in 1824 he gave it to his brother Johann.  In 1818 Beethoven received, also as a gift, a grand piano by  . Although Beethoven was proud to receive it, he seems to have been dissatisfied by its tone (a dissatisfaction which was perhaps also a consequence of his increasing deafness), and sought to get it remodelled to make it louder.  In 1825 Beethoven commissioned a piano from  , which was equipped with quadruple strings and a special resonator to make it audible to him, but which failed in this task. \n There is a museum—the  , in the place of his birth in  . Bonn has also hosted a musical festival, the  , since 1845. The festival was initially irregular but since 2007 has been organised annually.\n The  , in the  , in the campus of  , California, serves as a museum, research centre, and host of lectures and performances devoted solely to Beethoven's life and works. \n The   in   was unveiled in August 1845, in honour of the 75th anniversary of Beethoven's birth.
