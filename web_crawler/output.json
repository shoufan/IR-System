{"title": null, "content": "\n\n\n  (baptised 17 December 1770 – 26 March 1827) was a German composer and pianist. He is one of the most revered figures in the history of Western music; his works rank among the most performed of the   repertoire and span the   from the   to the   era in classical music. Beethoven's career has conventionally been divided into early, middle, and late periods. His early period, during which he forged his craft, is typically considered to have lasted until 1802. From 1802 to around 1812, his middle period showed an individual development from the styles of   and  , and is sometimes characterized as heroic. During this time, he began to grow increasingly  . In his late period, from 1812 to 1827, he extended his innovations in musical form and expression.\n Born in  , Beethoven displayed his musical talent at a young age. He was initially taught intensively by his father,  , and later by  . Under Neefe's tutelage in 1783, he published his first work, a set of keyboard variations. He found relief from a dysfunctional home life with the family of  , whose children he loved, befriended, and taught piano. At age 21, he moved to  , which subsequently became his base, and studied composition with Haydn. Beethoven then gained a reputation as a virtuoso pianist, and was soon patronised by   for compositions, which resulted in his three     (the earliest works to which he accorded an  ) in 1795.\n His first major orchestral work, the  , premiered in 1800, and his   was published in 1801. Despite his hearing deteriorating during this period, he continued to conduct, premiering his   and   in 1804 and 1808, respectively. His   appeared in 1806. His   (No. 5, Op. 73, known as the  ), dedicated to his frequent patron  , premiered in 1811, without Beethoven as soloist. He was almost completely deaf by 1814, and he then gave up performing and appearing in public. He described his problems with health and his unfulfilled personal life in two letters, his   (1802) to his brothers and his unsent love letter to an unknown \" \" (1812).\n After 1810, increasingly less socially involved, Beethoven composed many of his most admired works, including later symphonies, mature   and the  . His only opera,  , first performed in 1805, was revised to its final version in 1814. He composed   between 1819 and 1823 and his final Symphony,  , one of the first examples of a  , between 1822 and 1824. Written in his last years, his  , including the  , of 1825–1826 are among his final achievements. After several months of illness, which left him bedridden, he  .\n Beethoven was the grandson of  ,  a musician from the town of   in the Austrian   in what is now the   of  , who moved to   at the age of 21.  Ludwig was employed as a   singer at the court of  ,  , eventually rising to become, in 1761,   (music director) and hence a preeminent musician in Bonn. The portrait he commissioned of himself toward the end of his life remained displayed in his grandson's rooms as a talisman of his musical heritage.  Ludwig had two sons, the younger of whom,  , worked as a tenor in the same musical establishment and gave keyboard and   lessons to supplement his income. \n Johann married   in 1767; she was the daughter of Heinrich Keverich (1701–1751), who was head chef at the court of  ,  .  Beethoven was born of this marriage in Bonn, at what is now the   Museum, Bonngasse 20.  There is no authentic record of the date of his birth; but the registry of his  , in the   Parish of St. Remigius on 17 December 1770, survives, and the custom in the region at the time was to carry out baptism within 24 hours of birth. There is a consensus (with which Beethoven himself agreed) that his birth date was 16 December, but no documentary proof of this. \n Of the seven children born to Johann van Beethoven, only Ludwig, the second-born, and two younger brothers survived infancy.   (generally known as Karl) was born on 8 April 1774, and  , who was generally known as Johann, the youngest, was born on 2 October 1776. \n Beethoven's first music teacher was his father. He later had other local teachers, including the court   Gilles van den Eeden (d. 1782), Tobias Friedrich Pfeiffer, a family friend, who provided keyboard tuition, Franz Rovantini, a relative who instructed him in playing the violin and  ,  and court concertmaster  , who instructed Beethoven on the violin.  His tuition began in his fifth year. The regime was harsh and intensive, often reducing him to tears. With the involvement of Pfeiffer, who was an  , there were irregular late-night sessions with the young Beethoven dragged from his bed to the keyboard.  Beethoven's musical talent became obvious at a young age. Aware of  's successes in this area with his son   and daughter  , Johann attempted to promote his son as a  , claiming that Beethoven was six (he was seven) on the posters for his first public performance in March 1778. \n In 1780 or 1781, Beethoven began his studies with his most important teacher in Bonn,  .  Neefe taught him composition; in March 1783, Beethoven's first published work appeared, a set of keyboard variations (  63).  Beethoven soon began working with Neefe as assistant organist, at first unpaid (1782), and then as a paid employee (1784) of the court chapel.  His  , WoO 47, sometimes known as   (Elector) for their dedication to Elector  , were published in 1783.  In the same year, the first printed reference to Beethoven appeared in the   – \"Louis van Beethoven [sic] ... a boy of 11 years and most promising talent. He plays the piano very skilfully and with power, reads at sight very well ... the chief piece he plays is   of  , which Herr Neefe puts into his hands\".  Maximilian Friedrich's successor as Elector of Bonn was  . He gave some support to Beethoven, appointing him Court Organist and assisting financially with Beethoven's move to Vienna in 1792. \n During this time, Beethoven met several people who became important in his life. He developed a close relationship with the upper class   family, and gave piano lessons to some of the children. The widowed   became a \"second mother\" to Beethoven, taught him more refined manners and nurtured his passion for literature and poetry. The warmth and closeness of the von Breuning family offered the young Beethoven a retreat from his unhappy home life, dominated by his father's decline due to alcoholism. Beethoven also met  , a young medical student, who became a lifelong friend and married one of the von Breuning daughters. Another frequenter of the von Breunings was  , who became a friend and financial supporter to Beethoven during this period.  In 1791, Waldstein commissioned Beethoven's first work for the stage, the ballet   (WoO 1). \n The period of 1785 to 1790 includes virtually no record of Beethoven's activity as a composer. This may be attributed to the varied response his initial publications attracted, and also to ongoing issues in his family.  While passing through  , Beethoven visited with composer   and her husband, who gave him money to return to Bonn to be with his ailing mother.  Beethoven's mother died in July 1787, shortly after his return from Vienna, where he stayed for around two weeks and possibly met Mozart.  In 1789, due to his chronic alcoholism, Beethoven's father was forced to retire from the service of the Court and it was ordered that half of his father's pension be paid directly to Ludwig for support of the family.  Ludwig contributed further to the family's income by teaching (to which Wegeler said he had \"an extraordinary aversion\" ) and by playing   in the court orchestra. This familiarised him with a variety of operas, including works by Mozart,   and  .  There he also befriended  , a composer, flutist, and violinist of about his own age who was a nephew of the court orchestra's conductor,  . \n From 1790 to 1792, Beethoven composed several works, none of which were published at the time; they showed a growing range and maturity.   have identified a theme similar to those of his   in a set of variations written in 1791.  It was perhaps on Neefe's recommendation that Beethoven received his first commissions; the Literary Society in Bonn commissioned a cantata to mark the recent death of   (WoO 87), and a further cantata, to celebrate the subsequent accession of   as   (WoO 88), may have been commissioned by the Elector.  These two   were not performed during Beethoven's lifetime and became lost until the 1880s, when   called them \"Beethoven through and through\" and of the style that marked Beethoven's music distinct from the classical tradition. \n Beethoven probably was first introduced to   in late 1790, when Haydn was travelling to London and made a brief stop in Bonn around Christmastime.  In July 1792, they met again in Bonn on Haydn's return trip from London to Vienna, when Beethoven played in the orchestra at the  . Arrangements were likely made at that time for Beethoven to study with Haydn.  Waldstein wrote to Beethoven before his departure: \"You are going to Vienna in fulfilment of your long-frustrated wishes ... With the help of assiduous labour you shall receive Mozart's spirit from Haydn's hands.\" \n Beethoven left   for   in November 1792 amid rumours of  . Shortly after departing, Beethoven learned that his father had died.  Over the next few years, he responded to the widespread feeling that he was a successor to the recently deceased Mozart by studying Mozart's work and writing works with a distinctly Mozartian flavour. \n Beethoven did not immediately set out to establish himself as a composer, but rather devoted himself to study and performance. Working under Haydn's direction,  he sought to master  . He also studied violin under  .  Early in this period, he also began receiving occasional instruction from  , primarily in Italian vocal composition style; this relationship persisted until at least 1802, and possibly as late as 1809. \n With Haydn's departure for England in 1794, Beethoven was expected by the Elector to return home to Bonn. He chose instead to remain in Vienna, continuing his instruction in counterpoint with   and other teachers. In any case, by this time it must have seemed clear to his employer that Bonn would fall to the French, as it did in October 1794, effectively leaving Beethoven without a stipend or the necessity to return.  But several Viennese noblemen had already recognised his ability and offered him financial support, among them  ,  , and Baron  . \n Assisted by his connections with Haydn and Waldstein, Beethoven began to develop a reputation as a performer and improviser in the salons of the Viennese nobility.  His friend   began publishing his compositions, starting with a set of keyboard variations on a theme of   (WoO 66).  By 1793, he had established a reputation in Vienna as a piano virtuoso, but he apparently withheld works from publication so that their eventual appearance would have greater impact. \n In 1795, Beethoven made his public debut in Vienna over three days,  beginning with a performance of one of his own   on 29 March at the   and ending with a Mozart concerto on 31 March, probably the  , for which he had written a   soon after his arrival in Vienna. By this year he had two piano concertos available for performance, one in   he had begun composing before moving to Vienna and had worked on for over a decade, and one in   composed for the most part during 1795.  Viewing the latter as the more substantive work, he chose to designate it his  , publishing it in March 1801 as Opus 15, before publishing the former as   the following December. He wrote new cadenzas for both in 1809. \n Shortly after his public debut, Beethoven arranged for the publication of the first of his compositions to which he assigned an  , the  . These works were dedicated to his patron Prince Lichnowsky,  and were a financial success; Beethoven's profits were nearly sufficient to cover his living expenses for a year.  In 1799, Beethoven participated in (and won) a notorious piano 'duel' at the home of Baron Raimund Wetzlar (a former patron of Mozart) against the virtuoso  ; and the next year he similarly triumphed against   at the salon of  .  Beethoven's eighth piano sonata, the   (Op. 13, published in 1799), is described by the musicologist   as \"surpass[ing] any of his previous compositions, in strength of character, depth of emotion, level of originality, and ingenuity of motivic and tonal manipulation\". \n Between 1798 and 1800, Beethoven composed his   (commissioned by, and dedicated to, Prince Lobkowitz), published in 1801. He also completed his   (Op. 20) in 1799, a work which was extremely popular during Beethoven's lifetime. With premieres of his   and   Symphonies in 1800 and 1803, Beethoven became regarded as one of the most important of a generation of young composers following Haydn and Mozart. But his melodies, musical development, use of modulation and texture, and characterisation of emotion all set him apart from his influences, and heightened the impact some of his early works made when they were first published.  For the premiere of his First Symphony, he hired the   on 2 April 1800, and staged an extensive programme, including works by Haydn and Mozart, as well as his Septet, the Symphony, and one of his piano concertos (the latter three works all then unpublished). The concert, which the   called \"the most interesting concert in a long time\", was not without difficulties; among the criticisms was that \"the players did not bother to pay any attention to the soloist\".  By the end of 1800, Beethoven and his music were already much in demand from patrons and publishers. \n In May 1799, Beethoven taught piano to the daughters of Hungarian Countess Anna Brunsvik. During this time, he fell in love with the younger daughter,  . Among his other students, from 1801 to 1805, he tutored  , who went on to become a composer and later wrote about their encounters. The young  , who later became a renowned pianist and music teacher himself, studied with Beethoven from 1801 to 1803. In late 1801, Beethoven met a young countess,  , through the Brunsvik family; he mentions his love for Julie in a November 1801 letter to a friend, but class difference prevented any consideration of pursuing it. He dedicated his 1802  , now commonly known as the  , to her. \n In the spring of 1801, Beethoven completed a  ,   (op. 43). The work received numerous performances in 1801 and 1802 and he rushed to publish a piano arrangement to capitalise on its early popularity.  Beethoven completed his   in 1802, intended for performance at a concert that was cancelled. The symphony received its premiere one year later, at a subscription concert in April, 1803 at the  , where Beethoven had been appointed composer in residence. In addition to the Second Symphony, the concert also featured the First Symphony, the  , and the    . Reviews of the concert were mixed, but it was a financial success; Beethoven was able to charge three times the cost of a typical concert ticket. \n In 1802, Beethoven's brother Kaspar began to assist the composer in handling his affairs, particularly his business dealings with music publishers. In addition to successfully negotiating higher payments for Beethoven's latest works, Kaspar also began selling several of Beethoven's earlier unpublished compositions and encouraged his brother (against Beethoven's preference) to make arrangements and transcriptions of his more popular works for other instruments and combinations. Beethoven decided to accede to these requests, as he was powerless to prevent publishers from hiring others to do similar arrangements of his works. \n Beethoven told the English pianist   (in 1815) that his hearing loss began in 1798, during a heated quarrel with a singer.  During its gradual decline, his hearing was further impeded by a severe form of  .  As early as 1801, he wrote to Wegeler and another friend, Karl Amenda, describing his symptoms and the difficulties they caused in both professional and social settings (although it is likely some of his close friends were already aware of the issues).  The cause was probably  , possibly accompanied by degeneration of the  . \n On his doctor's advice, Beethoven moved to the small Austrian town of  , just outside Vienna, from April to October 1802 in an attempt to come to terms with his condition. There he wrote the document now known as the  , a letter to his brothers that records his thoughts of suicide due to his growing deafness and his resolution to continue living for and through his art. The letter was never sent and was discovered in his papers after his death.  The letters to Wegeler and Amenda were not so despairing; in them Beethoven commented also on his ongoing professional and financial success at this period, and his determination, as he expressed it to Wegeler, to \"seize Fate by the throat; it shall certainly not crush me completely\".  In 1806, Beethoven noted on one of his musical sketches: \"Let your deafness no longer be a secret—even in art.\" \n Beethoven's hearing loss did not prevent him from composing music, but it made playing at concerts—an important source of income at this phase of his life—increasingly difficult. It also contributed substantially to his social withdrawal.  Czerny remarked that Beethoven could still hear speech and music normally until 1812.  Beethoven never became totally deaf; in his final years he was still able to distinguish low tones and sudden loud sounds. \n Beethoven's return to   from Heiligenstadt was marked by a change in musical style, and is now often designated as the start of his middle or \"heroic\" period, characterised by many original works composed on a grand scale.  According to Czerny, Beethoven said: \"I am not satisfied with the work I have done so far. From now on I intend to take a new way.\"  An early major work employing this new style was the   in E-flat, Op. 55, known as the  , written in 1803–04. The idea of creating a symphony based on the career of   may have been suggested to Beethoven by   in 1798.  Sympathetic to the ideal of the heroic revolutionary leader, Beethoven originally gave the symphony the title \"Bonaparte\", but disillusioned by Napoleon  , he scratched Napoleon's name from the manuscript's title page, and the symphony was published in 1806 with its present title and the subtitle \"to celebrate the memory of a great man\".  The   was longer and larger in scope than any previous symphony. When it premiered in early 1805 it received a mixed reception. Some listeners objected to its length or disliked its structure, while others viewed it as a masterpiece. \n Other middle-period works extend in the same dramatic manner the musical language Beethoven had inherited. The   string quartets and the   and   piano sonatas share the Third Symphony's heroic spirit.  Other works of this period include the   through   Symphonies, the oratorio  , the opera  , and the  .  Beethoven was hailed in 1810 by the writer and composer  , in an influential review in the  , as the greatest of (what he considered) the three   composers (that is, ahead of Haydn and Mozart); in Beethoven's   his music, wrote Hoffmann, \"sets in motion terror, fear, horror, pain, and awakens the infinite yearning that is the essence of romanticism\". \n During this time, Beethoven's income came from publishing his works, from performances of them, and from his patrons, for whom he gave private performances and copies of works they commissioned for an exclusive period before their publication. Some of his early patrons, including Lobkowitz and Lichnowsky, gave him annual stipends in addition to commissioning works and purchasing published works.  Perhaps his most important aristocratic patron was  , the youngest son of  , who in 1803 or 1804 began to study piano and composition with him. They became friends, and their meetings continued until 1824.  Beethoven dedicated 14 compositions to Rudolf, including such major works as the   Op. 97 (1811) and   Op. 123 (1823).\n His position at the Theater an der Wien was terminated when the theatre changed management in early 1804, and he was forced to move temporarily to the suburbs of Vienna with his friend Stephan von Breuning. This slowed work on   (his original title for his opera), his largest work to date, for a time. It was delayed again by the Austrian   and finally premiered, under its present title of  , in November 1805 to houses that were nearly empty because of the  . In addition to being a financial failure, this version of   was also a critical failure, and Beethoven began revising it. \n Despite this failure, Beethoven continued to attract recognition. In 1807 the musician and publisher   secured the rights to publish his works in England, and Haydn's former patron   commissioned the  , Op. 86, for his wife's name-day. But he could not count on such recognition alone. A   he organized in December 1808, widely advertised, included the premieres of the Fifth and   symphonies, the  , extracts from the Mass in C, the     Op. 65 and the  . There was a large audience (including Czerny and the young  ), but it was under-rehearsed, involved many stops and starts, and during the Fantasia Beethoven was noted shouting at the musicians \"badly played, wrong, again!\" The financial outcome is unknown. \n In the autumn of 1808, after having been rejected for a position at the Royal Theatre, Beethoven received an offer from Napoleon's brother  , then king of  , for a well-paid position as   at the court in  . To persuade him to stay in Vienna, Archduke Rudolf,   and Prince Lobkowitz, after receiving representations from Beethoven's friends, pledged to pay him a pension of 4000 florins a year.  In the event, Rudolf paid his share of the pension on the agreed date.  Kinsky, immediately called to military duty, did not contribute and died in November 1812 after falling from his horse.  The Austrian currency destabilized and Lobkowitz went bankrupt in 1811 so that to benefit from the agreement Beethoven eventually had recourse to the law, which in 1815 brought him some recompense. \n The   reaching Vienna itself was felt in early 1809. In April, Beethoven completed writing his   in E-flat major, Op. 73,  which the musicologist   has called \"the apotheosis of the military concept\" in Beethoven's music.  Rudolf left the capital with the Imperial family in early May, prompting Beethoven's piano sonata   (Sonata No. 26, Op. 81a), actually titled by Beethoven in German   (The Farewell), of which the final movement,   (The Return), is dated in the manuscript with the date of Rudolf's homecoming of 30 January 1810.  During the French bombardment of Vienna in May, Beethoven took refuge in the cellar of his brother Kaspar's house.  The subsequent occupation of Vienna and disruptions to cultural life and to Beethoven's publishers, together with Beethoven's poor health at the end of 1809, explain his significantly reduced output during this period,  although other notable works of the year include his   in E-flat major, Op. 74 ( ) and the   in F-sharp major, Op. 78, dedicated to Josephine's sister  . \n At the end of 1809, Beethoven was commissioned to write incidental music for  's play  .   (an overture, and nine additional   and vocal pieces, Op. 84), which appeared in 1810, fit well with Beethoven's heroic style and he became interested in Goethe, setting three of his poems as songs (Op. 83) and learning about him from a mutual acquaintance,   (who also wrote to Goethe at this time about Beethoven). Other works of this period in a similar vein were the F minor  , to which Beethoven gave the subtitle  , and the Op. 97   known, from its dedication to his patron Rudolph, as the  . \n In the spring of 1811, Beethoven became seriously ill, with headaches and high fever. His doctor   recommended he take a cure at the   of   (now Teplice in the  ), where he wrote two more overtures and sets of incidental music for dramas, this time by   –   Op. 117 and   Op. 113. Advised again to visit Teplitz in 1812, he met there with Goethe, who wrote: \"His talent amazed me; unfortunately he is an utterly untamed personality, who is not altogether wrong in holding the world to be detestable, but surely does not make it any more enjoyable ... by his attitude.\" Beethoven wrote to his publishers  , \"Goethe delights far too much in the court atmosphere, far more than is becoming in a poet.\"  But following their meeting he began a setting for choir and orchestra of    , Op. 112, completed in 1815. After it was published in 1822 with a dedication to the poet, Beethoven wrote to him: \"The admiration, the love and esteem which already in my youth I cherished for the one and only immortal Goethe have persisted.\" \n While Beethoven was at Teplitz in 1812, he wrote a ten-page love letter to his \" \", which he never sent to its addressee.  The identity of the intended recipient was long a subject of debate, although the musicologist   has argued that the intended recipient was  ; other candidates included Julie Guicciardi,   and Josephine Brunsvik. \n All of these had been regarded by Beethoven as possible soulmates during his first decade in Vienna. Guicciardi, although she flirted with Beethoven, never had any serious interest in him and married   in November 1803. (Beethoven insisted to his later secretary and biographer,  , that Guicciardi had \"sought me out, crying, but I scorned her\".)  Josephine had, since Beethoven's initial infatuation with her, married the elderly Count Joseph Deym, who died in 1804. Beethoven began to visit her and commenced a passionate correspondence. Initially, he accepted that Josephine could not love him, but he continued to address himself to her even after she had moved to Budapest, finally demonstrating that he had got the message in his last letter to her of 1807: \"I thank you for wishing still to appear as if I were not altogether banished from your memory\".  Malfatti was the niece of Beethoven's doctor, and he had proposed to her in 1810. He was 40, and she was 19. The proposal was rejected.  She is now remembered as the recipient of the piano    . \n Antonie (Toni) Brentano (née von Birkenstock), ten years younger than Beethoven, was the wife of Franz Brentano, the half-brother of  , who provided Beethoven's introduction to the family. It would seem that Antonie and Beethoven had an affair during 1811–1812. Antonie left Vienna with her husband in late 1812 and never met with (or apparently corresponded with) Beethoven again, although in her later years she wrote and spoke fondly of him.  Some speculate that Beethoven was the father of Antonie's son Karl Josef, though the two never met. \n After 1812 there are no reports of any romantic liaisons of Beethoven's; however, it is clear from his correspondence of the period and, later, from the conversation books, that he occasionally had sex with prostitutes. \n In early 1813, Beethoven apparently went through a difficult emotional period, and his compositional output dropped. His personal appearance degraded—it had generally been neat—as did his manners in public, notably when dining. \n Family issues may have played a part in this. Beethoven had visited his brother Johann at the end of October 1812. He wished to end Johann's cohabitation with Therese Obermayer, a woman who already had an illegitimate child. He was unable to convince Johann to end the relationship and appealed to the local civic and religious authorities, but Johann and Therese married on 8 November. \n The illness and eventual death of his brother Kaspar from   became an increasing concern. Kaspar had been ill for some time; in 1813 Beethoven lent him 1500  , to procure the repayment of which he was ultimately led to complex legal measures.  After Kaspar died on 15 November 1815, Beethoven immediately became embroiled in a protracted legal dispute with Kaspar's widow   over custody of their son  , then nine years old. Beethoven had successfully applied to Kaspar to have himself named the sole guardian of the boy. A late   to Kaspar's will gave him and Johanna joint guardianship.  While Beethoven was successful at having his nephew removed from her custody in January 1816, and had him removed to a private school,  in 1818 he was again preoccupied with the legal processes around Karl. While giving evidence to the court for the  , the  , Beethoven was unable to prove that he was of noble birth and as a consequence, on 18 December 1818 the case was transferred to the civil   of Vienna, where he lost sole guardianship.  He regained custody after intensive legal struggles in 1820.  During the years that followed, Beethoven frequently interfered in his nephew's life in what Karl perceived as an overbearing manner. \n Beethoven was finally motivated to begin significant composition again in June 1813 when news arrived of the French defeat at the   by a coalition led by the  . The inventor   persuaded him to write a work commemorating the event for his mechanical instrument the  . This Beethoven also transcribed for orchestra as   (Op. 91, also known as the  ).  It was first performed on 8 December, along with his  , Op. 92, at a charity concert for victims of the war, a concert whose success led to its repeat on 12 December. The orchestra included several leading and rising musicians who happened to be in Vienna at the time, including   and  .  The work received repeat performances at concerts staged by Beethoven in January and February 1814.  These concerts brought Beethoven more profit than any others in his career, and enabled him to buy the bank shares that were the most valuable assets in his estate at his death. \n Beethoven's renewed popularity led to demands for a revival of  , which, in its third revised version, was also well received at its July opening in Vienna, and was frequently staged there during the following years.  Beethoven's publisher,  , commissioned the 20-year-old Moscheles to prepare a piano score of the opera, which he inscribed \"Finished, with God's help!\"—to which Beethoven added \"O Man, help thyself.\"  That summer Beethoven composed a piano sonata for the first time in five years, his  .  He was also one of many composers who produced music in a patriotic vein to entertain the many heads of state and diplomats who came to the   that began in November 1814, with the cantata   (Op. 136) and similar choral works which, in the words of Maynard Solomon, \"broadened Beethoven's popularity, [but] did little to enhance his reputation as a serious composer\". \n In April and May 1814, playing in his   Trio, Beethoven made his last public appearances as a soloist. The composer   noted: \"the piano was badly out of tune, which Beethoven minded little, since he did not hear it ... there was scarcely anything left of the virtuosity of the artist ... I was deeply saddened.\"  From 1814 onward Beethoven used for conversation   designed by   (a number of these are on display at the Beethoven-Haus in Bonn). \n His 1815 compositions include an expressive second setting of the poem   (Op. 94) in 1815. Compared to its first setting in 1805 (a gift for Josephine Brunsvik), it was \"far more dramatic ... The entire spirit is that of an operatic scena.\"  But his energy seemed to be dropping: apart from these works, he wrote the two  , and a few minor pieces, and began but abandoned a sixth piano concerto. \n Between 1815 and 1819, Beethoven's output dropped again to a level unique in his mature life.  He attributed part of this to a lengthy illness that he called an inflammatory fever that he had for more than a year starting in October 1816.  Solomon suggests it is also doubtless a consequence of the ongoing legal problems concerning his nephew Karl,  and of Beethoven finding himself increasingly at odds with current musical trends. Unsympathetic to developments in German romanticism that featured the supernatural (as in operas by Spohr,   and  ), he also \"resisted the impending Romantic fragmentation of the ... cyclic forms of the Classical era into small forms and lyric mood pieces\" and turned towards study of Bach,   and  .  An old connection was renewed in 1817 when Maelzel sought, and obtained, Beethoven's endorsement for his newly developed  .  During these years the few major works he completed include the 1818   (Sonata No. 29 in B-flat major, Op. 106) and his settings of poems by  ,   Op. 98 (1816), which introduced the   into classical repertoire.  In 1818 he began musical sketches that eventually formed part of his Ninth Symphony. \n By early 1818 Beethoven's health had improved, and his nephew Karl, now aged 11, moved in with him in January (although within a year Karl's mother had won him back in the courts).  By now Beethoven's hearing had again seriously deteriorated, necessitating that he and his interlocutors write in notebooks to carry out conversations. These 'conversation books' are a rich written resource for his life from this period onward. They contain discussions about music, business, and personal life; they are also a valuable source for his contacts and for investigations into how he intended his music should be performed, and of his opinions of the art of music.    His household management had also improved somewhat with the help of  . A proprietor of the Stein piano workshop and a personal friend, Streicher had assisted in Beethoven's care during his illness; she continued to provide some support, and in her he finally found a skilled cook.  A testimonial to the esteem in which Beethoven was held in England was the presentation to him in this year by Thomas Broadwood, the proprietor of the company, of a  , for which Beethoven expressed thanks. He was not well enough, however, to carry out a visit to London that year which had been proposed by the  . \n Despite the time occupied by his ongoing legal struggles over Karl, which involved continuing extensive correspondence and lobbying,  two events sparked off Beethoven's major composition projects in 1819. The first was the announcement of Archduke Rudolf's promotion to  -  as Archbishop of   (now in the Czech Republic), which triggered the   Op. 123, intended to be ready for his installation in Olomouc in March 1820. The other was the invitation by the publisher   to 50 Viennese composers, including Beethoven,  , Czerny and the 8-year-old  , to compose a variation each on a theme which he provided. Beethoven was spurred to outdo the competition and by mid-1819 had already completed 20 variations of what were to become the 33   op. 120. Neither of these works was completed for a few years.  A significant tribute of 1819, however, was Archduke Rudolf's set of 40 piano variations on a theme written for him by Beethoven (WoO 200) and dedicated to the master.  Beethoven's portrait by   of this year, which was one of the most familiar images of him for the next century, was described by Schindler as, despite its artistic weaknesses, \"in the rendering of that particular look, the majestic forehead ... the firmly shut mouth and the chin shaped like a shell, ... truer to nature than any other picture\".    also created  . \n Beethoven's determination over the following years to write the   for Rudolf was not motivated by any devout  . Although he had been born a Catholic, the form of religion as practised at the court in Bonn where he grew up was, in the words of Solomon, \"a compromise ideology that permitted a relatively peaceful coexistence between the Church and  \".  Beethoven's   (a diary he kept on an occasional basis between 1812 and 1818) shows his interest in a variety of religious philosophies, including those of India, Egypt and the Orient and the writings of the  .  In a letter to Rudolf of July 1821, Beethoven shows his belief in a personal God: \"God ... sees into my innermost heart and knows that as a man I perform most conscientiously and on all occasions the duties which Humanity, God, and Nature enjoin upon me.\" On one of the sketches for the   he wrote \"Plea for inner and outer peace\". \n Beethoven's status was confirmed by the series of   given in Vienna by the choirmaster Franz Xaver Gebauer in the 1819/1820 and 1820/1821 seasons, during which all eight of his symphonies to date, plus the oratorio   and the Mass in C, were performed. Beethoven was typically underwhelmed: when in an April 1820 conversation book a friend mentioned Gebauer, Beethoven wrote in reply \"Geh! Bauer\" (Begone, peasant!) \n In 1819, Beethoven was first approached by the publisher  , who won the suspicious composer round, while visiting him at  , by procuring for him a plate of roast veal.  One consequence of this was that Schlesinger secured Beethoven's three last piano sonatas and his final quartets; part of the attraction to Beethoven was that Schlesinger had publishing facilities in Germany and France, and connections in England, which could overcome problems of copyright piracy.  The first of the three sonatas, for which Beethoven contracted with Schlesinger in 1820 at 30   per sonata (further delaying completion of the Mass), was sent to the publisher at the end of that year (the  , dedicated to Maximiliane, Antonie Brentano's daughter). \n In early 1821, Beethoven was once again in poor health with   and  . Despite this he continued work on the remaining piano sonatas he had promised to Schlesinger (the   was published in December), and on the Mass.  In early 1822 Beethoven sought a reconciliation with his brother Johann, whose marriage in 1812 had met with his disapproval, and Johann now became a regular visitor (as witnessed by the conversation books of the period) and began to assist him in his business affairs, including lending him money against ownership of some of his compositions. He also sought some reconciliation with the mother of his nephew, including supporting her income, although this did not meet with the approval of the contrary Karl.  Two commissions at the end of 1822 improved Beethoven's financial prospects. In November the   of London offered a commission for a symphony, which he accepted with delight, as an appropriate home for the Ninth Symphony on which he was working.  Also in November Prince   of   offered to pay Beethoven's asking price for three string quartets. Beethoven set the price at the high level of 50 ducats per quartet in a letter dictated to his nephew Karl, who was then living with him. \n During 1822, Anton Schindler, who in 1840 became one of Beethoven's earliest and most influential (but not always reliable) biographers, began to work as the composer's unpaid secretary. He later claimed that he had been a member of Beethoven's circle since 1814, but there is no evidence for this. Cooper suggests that \"Beethoven greatly appreciated his assistance, but did not think much of him as a man\". \n The year 1823 saw the completion of three notable works, all of which had occupied Beethoven for some years: the  , the Ninth Symphony and the  . \n Beethoven at last presented the manuscript of the completed   to Rudolph on 19 March (more than a year after the archduke's enthronement as archbishop). But he was in no hurry to get it published or performed as he had formed a notion that he could profitably sell manuscripts of the work to various courts in Germany and Europe at 50 ducats each. One of the few who took up this offer was   of France, who also sent Beethoven a heavy gold medallion.  The Symphony and the variations took up most of the rest of Beethoven's working year. Diabelli hoped to publish both works, but the potential prize of the Mass excited many other publishers to lobby Beethoven for it, including Schlesinger and  . (In the end, it was obtained by  ). \n \nBeethoven had become critical of the Viennese reception of his works. He told the visiting   in 1822: You will hear nothing of me here ...  ? They cannot give it, nor do they want to listen to it. The symphonies? They have no time for them. My concertos? Everyone grinds out only the stuff he himself has made. The solo pieces? They went out of fashion long ago, and here fashion is everything. At the most,   occasionally digs up a quartet.  He therefore enquired about premiering the   and the Ninth Symphony in Berlin. When his Viennese admirers learnt of this, they pleaded with him to arrange local performances. Beethoven was won over, and the symphony was first performed, along with sections of the  , on 7 May 1824, to great acclaim at the  .  Beethoven stood by the conductor   during the concert beating time (although Umlauf had warned the singers and orchestra to ignore him), and because of his deafness was not even aware of the applause which followed until he was turned to witness it.  The   gushed, \"inexhaustible genius had shown us a new world\", and Carl Czerny wrote that the Symphony \"breathes such a fresh, lively, indeed youthful spirit ... so much power, innovation, and beauty as ever [came] from the head of this original man, although he certainly sometimes led the old wigs to shake their heads\". The concert did not net Beethoven much money, as the expenses of mounting it were very high.  A second concert on 24 May, in which the producer guaranteed him a minimum fee, was poorly attended; nephew Karl noted that \"many people [had] already gone into the country\". It was Beethoven's last public concert.  Beethoven accused Schindler of either cheating him or mismanaging the ticket receipts; this led to the replacement of Schindler as Beethoven's secretary by  , the second violinist in the  , although by 1826 Beethoven and Schindler reconciled. \n Beethoven then turned to writing the string quartets for Galitzin, despite failing health. The first of these, the   was premiered by the Schuppanzigh Quartet in March 1825. While writing the next, the  , in April 1825, he was struck by a sudden illness. Recuperating in  , he included in the quartet its slow movement to which he gave the title \"Holy song of thanks (Heiliger Dankgesang) to the Divinity, from a convalescent, in the  \".  The next quartet to be completed was the  , in B♭ major. In six movements, the last, contrapuntal movement proved very difficult for both the performers and the audience at its premiere in March 1826 (again by the Schuppanzigh Quartet). Beethoven was persuaded by the publisher  , for an additional fee, to write a new finale, and to issue the last movement as a separate work (the  , Op. 133).  Beethoven's favourite was the last of this series, the  , which he rated as his most perfect single work. \n Beethoven's relations with his nephew Karl had continued to be stormy; Beethoven's letters to him were demanding and reproachful. In August, Karl, who had been seeing his mother again against Beethoven's wishes, attempted suicide by shooting himself in the head. He survived and after discharge from hospital went to recuperate in the village of   with Beethoven and his uncle Johann. In Gneixendorf, Beethoven completed a further quartet ( ), which he sent to Schlesinger. Under the introductory slow chords in the last movement, Beethoven wrote in the manuscript \"Muss es sein?\" (Must it be?); the response, over the faster main theme of the movement, is \"Es muss sein!\" (It must be!). The whole movement is headed   (The difficult decision).  Following this in November Beethoven completed his final composition, the replacement finale for the op. 130 quartet.  Beethoven at this time was already ill and depressed;  he began to quarrel with Johann, insisting that Johann make Karl his heir, in preference to Johann's wife. \n On his return journey to   from Gneixendorf in December 1826, illness struck Beethoven again. He was attended until his death by Dr. Andreas Wawruch, who throughout December noticed symptoms including fever,   and  , with swollen limbs, coughing and breathing difficulties. Several operations were carried out to tap off the excess fluid from Beethoven's abdomen. \n Karl stayed by Beethoven's bedside during December, but left after the beginning of January to join the army at   and did not see his uncle again, although he wrote to him shortly afterwards: \"My dear father ... I am living in contentment and regret only that I am separated from you.\" Immediately following Karl's departure, Beethoven wrote a will making his nephew his sole heir.  Later in January, Beethoven was attended by Dr. Malfatti, whose treatment (recognizing the seriousness of his patient's condition) was largely centred on alcohol. As the news spread of the severity of Beethoven's condition, many old friends came to visit, including Diabelli, Schuppanzigh, Lichnowsky, Schindler, the composer   and his pupil  . Many tributes and gifts were also sent, including £100 from the Philharmonic Society in London and a case of expensive wine from Schotts.  During this period, Beethoven was almost completely bedridden despite occasional efforts to rouse himself. On 24 March, he said to Schindler and the others present \"Plaudite, amici, comoedia finita est\" (\"Applaud, friends, the comedy is over\"). Later that day, when the wine from Schotts arrived, he whispered, \"Pity – too late.\" \n Beethoven died on 26 March 1827 at the age of 56; only his friend   and a \"Frau van Beethoven\" (possibly his old enemy Johanna van Beethoven) were present. According to Hüttenbrenner, at about 5 pm there was a flash of lightning and a clap of thunder: \"Beethoven opened his eyes, lifted his right hand and looked up for several seconds with his fist clenched ... not another breath, not a heartbeat more.\"  Many visitors came to the death-bed; some locks of the dead man's hair were retained by Hüttenbrenner and Hiller, among others.  An   revealed Beethoven had significant   damage, which may have been due to his heavy alcohol consumption,  and also considerable dilation of the auditory and other related nerves. \n Beethoven's funeral procession in Vienna on 29 March 1827 was attended by an estimated 10,000 people.    and the violinist   were among the torchbearers. A funeral oration by the poet   (who would also write Schubert's epitaph) was read by the actor  .  Beethoven was buried in the   cemetery, north-west of Vienna, after a   at the church of the Holy Trinity (Dreifaltigkeitskirche) in Alserstrasse. Beethoven's remains were   for study in 1863, and moved in 1888 to Vienna's   where they were reinterred in a grave adjacent to that of Schubert. \n The historian William Drabkin notes that as early as 1818 a writer had proposed a three-period division of Beethoven's works and that such a division (albeit often adopting different dates or works to denote changes in period) eventually became a convention adopted by all of Beethoven's biographers, starting with Schindler,   and  . Later writers sought to identify sub-periods within this generally accepted structure. Its drawbacks include that it generally omits a fourth period, that is, the early years in Bonn, whose works are less often considered; and that it ignores the differential development of Beethoven's composing styles over the years for different categories of work. The piano sonatas, for example, were written throughout Beethoven's life in a progression that can be interpreted as continuous development; the symphonies do not all demonstrate linear progress; of all of the types of composition, perhaps the quartets, which seem to group themselves in three periods (Op. 18 in 1801–1802, Opp. 59, 74 and 95 in 1806–1814, and the quartets, today known as 'late', from 1824 onwards) fit this categorization most neatly. Drabkin concludes that \"now that we have lived with them so long ... as long as there are programme notes, essays written to accompany recordings, and all-Beethoven recitals, it is hard to imagine us ever giving up the notion of discrete stylistic periods.\" \n Some forty compositions, including ten very early works written by Beethoven up to 1785, survive from the years that Beethoven lived in Bonn. It has been suggested that Beethoven largely abandoned composition between 1785 and 1790, possibly as a result of negative critical reaction to his first published works. A 1784 review in  's influential   compared Beethoven's efforts to those of rank beginners.  The three early piano quartets of 1785 (WoO 36), closely modelled on violin sonatas of Mozart, show his dependency on the music of the period. Beethoven himself was not to give any of the Bonn works an opus number, save for those which he reworked for use later in his career, for example, some of the songs in his Op. 52 collection (1805) and the   reworked in Vienna in 1793 to become his  .    points out that Bonn was something of a backwater compared to Vienna; Beethoven was unlikely to be acquainted with the mature works of Haydn or Mozart, and Rosen opines that his early style was closer to that of Hummel or  .  Kernan suggests that at this stage Beethoven was not especially notable for his works in   style, but more for his vocal music; his move to Vienna in 1792 set him on the path to develop the music in the genres he became known for. \n The conventional first period begins after Beethoven's arrival in Vienna in 1792. In the first few years he seems to have composed less than he did at Bonn, and his Piano Trios, op.1 were not published until 1795. From this point onward, he had mastered the 'Viennese style' (best known today from   and  ) and was making the style his own. His works from 1795 to 1800 are larger in scale than was the norm (writing sonatas in four movements, not three, for instance); typically he uses a   rather than a  ; and his music often includes dramatic, even sometimes over-the-top, uses of extreme dynamics and tempi and chromatic harmony. It was this that led Haydn to believe the third trio of Op.1 was too difficult for an audience to appreciate. \n He also explored new directions and gradually expanded the scope and ambition of his work. Some important pieces from the early period are the   and   symphonies, the set of six string quartets  , the first two piano concertos, and the first dozen or so  , including the famous   sonata, Op. 13.\n His middle period began shortly after the personal crisis brought on by his recognition of encroaching deafness. It includes large-scale works that express heroism and struggle. Middle-period works include six symphonies (Nos. 3–8), the last two piano concertos, the   and  , five string quartets (Nos. 7–11), several piano sonatas (including the   and   sonatas), the   violin sonata and his only  ,  .\n This period is sometimes associated with a   manner of composing,  but the use of the term \"heroic\" has become increasingly controversial in Beethoven scholarship. The term is more frequently used as an alternative name for the middle period.  The appropriateness of the term heroic to describe the whole middle period has been questioned as well: while some works, like the Third and Fifth Symphonies, are easy to describe as heroic, many others, like his   or his  , are not. \n Beethoven's late period began in the decade 1810-1819.  He began a renewed study of older music, including works by  ,  , and  , whom Beethoven considered \"the greatest composer who ever lived\".  Beethoven's late works incorporated   and  -era devices.  For example, the overture   (1822) included a fugue influenced by Handel's music.  A new style emerged, as he returned to the keyboard to compose his first piano sonatas in almost a decade; the works of the late period include the last five piano sonatas and the  , the last two sonatas for cello and piano, the   (including the massive  ), and two works for very large forces: the   and the  .  Works from this period are characterised by their intellectual depth, their formal innovations, and their intense, highly personal expression. The   has seven linked movements, and the   adds choral forces to the orchestra in the last movement. \n Beethoven's earlier preferred pianos included those of  ; he may have been given a Stein piano by Count Waldstein.  From 1786 onwards there is evidence of Beethoven's cooperation with  , who had married Stein's daughter  . Streicher left Stein's business to set up his own firm in 1803, and Beethoven continued to admire his products, writing to him in 1817 of his \"special preference\" for his pianos.  Among the other pianos Beethoven possessed was an   piano given to him by the manufacturer in 1803.  The Érard piano, with its exceptional resonance, may have influenced Beethoven's piano style – shortly after receiving it he began writing his   – but despite initial enthusiasm he seems to have abandoned it before 1810, when he wrote that it was \"simply not of any use any more\"; in 1824 he gave it to his brother Johann.  In 1818 Beethoven received, also as a gift, a grand piano by  . Although Beethoven was proud to receive it, he seems to have been dissatisfied by its tone (a dissatisfaction which was perhaps also a consequence of his increasing deafness), and sought to get it remodelled to make it louder.  In 1825 Beethoven commissioned a piano from  , which was equipped with quadruple strings and a special resonator to make it audible to him, but which failed in this task. \n There is a museum—the  , in the place of his birth in  . Bonn has also hosted a musical festival, the  , since 1845. The festival was initially irregular but since 2007 has been organised annually.\n The  , in the  , in the campus of  , California, serves as a museum, research centre, and host of lectures and performances devoted solely to Beethoven's life and works. \n The   in   was unveiled in August 1845, in honour of the 75th anniversary of Beethoven's birth.

In children, hearing problems can affect the ability to   spoken  , and in adults it can create difficulties with social interaction and at work.  Hearing loss can be temporary or permanent.   usually affects both ears and is due to   loss.  In some people, particularly older people, hearing loss can result in loneliness. \n Hearing loss may be caused by a number of factors, including:  ,  ,  , some  , birth complications, trauma to the ear, and certain medications or toxins.  A common condition that results in hearing loss is  .  Certain infections during pregnancy, such as  ,   and  , may also cause hearing loss in the child.  Hearing loss is diagnosed when   finds that a person is unable to hear 25   in at least one ear.  Testing for poor hearing is recommended for all newborns.  Hearing loss can be categorized as mild (25 to 40  ), moderate (41 to 55 dB), moderate-severe (56 to 70 dB), severe (71 to 90 dB), or profound (greater than 90 dB).  There are three main types of hearing loss:  ,  , and mixed hearing loss. \n About half of hearing loss globally is preventable through public health measures.  Such practices include  , proper care around  , avoiding loud noise, and avoiding certain medications.  The   recommends that young people limit exposure to loud sounds and the use of   to an hour a day in an effort to limit exposure to noise.  Early identification and support are particularly important in children.  For many,  ,  ,   and   are useful.    is another useful skill some develop.  Access to hearing aids, however, is limited in many areas of the world. \n As of 2013 hearing loss affects about 1.1 billion people to some degree.  It causes disability in about 466 million people (5% of the global population), and moderate to severe disability in 124 million people.  Of those with moderate to severe disability 108 million live in low and middle income countries.  Of those with hearing loss, it began during childhood for 65 million.  Those who use sign language and are members of   may see themselves as having a difference rather than a  .  Many members of Deaf culture oppose attempts to cure deafness  and some within this community view cochlear implants with concern as they have the potential to eliminate their culture. \n Use of the terms \"hearing impaired\", \"deaf-mute\", or \"deaf and dumb\" to describe deaf and hard of hearing people is discouraged by many in the deaf community as well as advocacy organizations, as they are offensive to many deaf and hard of hearing people. \n Human hearing extends in frequency from 20 to 20,000 Hz, and in intensity from 0 dB to 120 dB HL or more. 0 dB does not represent absence of sound, but rather the softest sound an average unimpaired human ear can hear; some people can hear down to −5 or even −10 dB.  Sound is generally uncomfortably loud above 90 dB and 115 dB represents the  . The ear does not hear all frequencies equally well: hearing sensitivity peaks around 3,000 Hz.  There are many qualities of human hearing besides frequency range and intensity that cannot easily be measured quantitatively. However, for many practical purposes, normal hearing is defined by a frequency versus intensity graph, or audiogram, charting sensitivity thresholds of hearing at defined frequencies.  Because of the cumulative impact of age and exposure to noise and other acoustic insults, 'typical' hearing may not be normal. \n Hearing loss is sensory, but may have accompanying symptoms:\n There may also be accompanying secondary symptoms:\n Hearing loss is associated with   and  .  The risk increases with the hearing loss degree. There are several hypotheses including cognitive resources being redistributed to hearing and social isolation from hearing loss having a negative effect.  According to preliminary data,   usage can slow down the decline in  . \n Hearing loss is responsible for causing   in the brain which is a cause for several neurological disorders including   and  .\n Hearing loss is an increasing concern especially in aging populations. The prevalence of hearing loss increases about two-fold for each decade increase in age after age 40.  While the secular trend might decrease individual level risk of developing hearing loss, the prevalence of hearing loss is expected to rise due to the aging population in the US. Another concern about aging process is cognitive decline, which may progress to   and eventually dementia.  The association between hearing loss and cognitive decline has been studied in various research settings. Despite the variability in study design and protocols, the majority of these studies have found consistent association between age-related hearing loss and cognitive decline, cognitive impairment, and dementia.  The association between age-related hearing loss and Alzheimer's disease was found to be nonsignificant, and this finding supports the hypothesis that hearing loss is associated with dementia independent of Alzheimer pathology.  There are several hypotheses about the underlying causal mechanism for age-related hearing loss and cognitive decline. One hypothesis is that this association can be explained by common etiology or shared neurobiological pathology with decline in other physiological system.  Another possible cognitive mechanism emphasize on individual's  . As people developing hearing loss in the process of aging, the cognitive load demanded by auditory perception increases, which may lead to change in brain structure and eventually to dementia.  One other hypothesis suggests that the association between hearing loss and cognitive decline is mediated through various psychosocial factors, such as decrease in   and increase in  .  Findings on the association between hearing loss and dementia have significant public health implication, since about 9% of dementia cases are associated with hearing loss. \n  have important health implications, especially for an aging population where they can lead to significant morbidity and mortality. Elderly people are particularly vulnerable to the consequences of injuries caused by falls, since older individuals typically have greater bone fragility and poorer protective reflexes.  Fall-related injury can also lead to burdens on the financial and health care systems.  In literature, age-related hearing loss is found to be significantly associated with incident falls.  There is also a potential   between hearing loss and falls—greater severity of hearing loss is associated with increased difficulties in postural control and increased prevalence of falls.  The underlying causal link between the association of hearing loss and falls is yet to be elucidated. There are several hypotheses that indicate that there may be a common process between decline in   and increase in incident falls, driven by physiological, cognitive, and behavioral factors.  This evidence suggests that treating hearing loss has potential to increase   in older adults. \n  is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. In older adults, the suicide rate is higher than it is for younger adults, and more suicide cases are attributable to depression.  Different studies have been done to investigate potential risk factors that can give rise to depression in later life. Some chronic diseases are found to be significantly associated with risk of developing depression, such as  ,  ,   and hearing loss.  Hearing loss can attribute to decrease in health-related quality of life, increase in social isolation and decline in social engagement, which are all risk factors for increased risk of developing depression symptoms. \n  is hearing loss that is sustained after the  , which can occur due to  ,  , or as a side-effect of a medicine. Typically, hearing loss is gradual and often detected by family and friends of affected individuals long before the patients themselves will acknowledge the disability.  Post-lingual deafness is far more common than pre-lingual deafness. Those who lose their hearing later in life, such as in late adolescence or adulthood, face their own challenges, living with the adaptations that allow them to live independently.\n  is profound hearing loss that is sustained before the acquisition of language, which can occur due to a   condition or through hearing loss before birth or in early infancy. Prelingual deafness impairs an individual's ability to acquire a   language in children, but deaf children can acquire spoken language through support from cochlear implants (sometimes combined with hearing aids).  Non-signing (hearing) parents of deaf babies (90–95% of cases) usually go with oral approach without the support of sign language, as these families lack previous experience with   and cannot competently provide it to their children without learning it themselves. This may in some cases (late implantation or not sufficient benefit from cochlear implants) bring the risk of   for the deaf baby  because the deaf baby would not have a sign language if the child is unable to acquire spoken language successfully. The 5–10% of cases of deaf babies born into signing families have the potential of age-appropriate development of language due to early exposure to a   by sign-competent parents, thus they have the potential to meet language milestones, in sign language in lieu of spoken language. \n Hearing loss has multiple causes, including ageing, genetics, perinatal problems and acquired causes like noise and disease.  For some kinds of hearing loss the cause may be classified as  .\n There is a progressive loss of ability to hear high frequencies with aging known as  . For men, this can start as early as 25 and women at 30. Although genetically variable, it is a normal concomitant of ageing and is distinct from hearing losses caused by noise exposure, toxins or disease agents.  Common conditions that can increase the risk of hearing loss in elderly people are  ,  , or the use of certain medications harmful to the ear.  While everyone loses hearing with age, the amount and type of hearing loss is variable. \n  (NIHL), also known as  , typically manifests as elevated hearing thresholds (i.e. less sensitivity or muting). Noise exposure is the cause of approximately half of all cases of hearing loss, causing some degree of problems in 5% of the population globally.  The majority of hearing loss is not due to age, but due to noise exposure.  Various governmental, industry and standards organizations set noise standards.  Many people are unaware of the presence of environmental sound at damaging levels, or of the level at which sound becomes harmful. Common sources of damaging noise levels include car stereos, children's toys, motor vehicles, crowds, lawn and maintenance equipment, power tools, gun use, musical instruments, and even hair dryers. Noise damage is cumulative; all sources of damage must be considered to assess risk. In the US, 12.5% of children aged 6–19 years have permanent hearing damage from excessive noise exposure.   The World Health Organization estimates that half of those between 12 and 35 are at risk from using   that are too loud.  Hearing loss in adolescents may be caused by loud noise from toys, music by headphones, and concerts or events. \n Hearing loss can be inherited. Around 75–80% of all these cases are inherited by  , 20–25% are inherited by  , 1–2% are inherited by   patterns, and fewer than 1% are inherited by  .   Syndromic deafness occurs when there are other signs or medical problems aside from deafness in an individual,  such as  ,  ,  ,  , and  .   occurs when there are no other signs or medical problems associated with the deafness in an individual. \n  are reported to cause hearing loss in up to 64% of infants born to   mothers, from the ototoxic effect on the developing fetus plus malnutrition during pregnancy from the excess   intake.   can be associated with sensorineural hearing loss because of an increased risk of  ,  , ototoxic medication and infection as well as noise exposure in the neonatal units. Also, hearing loss in premature babies is often discovered far later than a similar hearing loss would be in a full-term baby because normally babies are given a hearing test within 48 hours of birth, but doctors must wait until the premature baby is medically stable before testing hearing, which can be months after birth.  The risk of hearing loss is greatest for those weighing less than 1500 g at birth.\n Disorders responsible for hearing loss include  ,   ,    variant 1E,   ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  , recurring ear infections, strokes,  ,  ,  ,  ,  , and   syndrome,  ,  , and   such as  ,  , congenital   (also called German measles) syndrome, several varieties of  ,   ,  and  .\n Some medications may reversibly affect hearing. These medications are considered  . This includes   such as furosemide and bumetanide,   (NSAIDs) both over-the-counter (aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen) as well as prescription (celecoxib, diclofenac, etc.), paracetamol,  , and  .  Others may cause permanent hearing loss.  The most important group is the   (main member  ) and platinum based chemotherapeutics such as   and  . \n In addition to medications, hearing loss can also result from specific chemicals in the environment: metals, such as  ;  , such as   (found in  ,   and  ,  for example); and  .  Combined with noise, these ototoxic chemicals have an additive effect on a person's hearing loss.  Hearing loss due to chemicals starts in the high frequency range and is irreversible. It damages the   with lesions and degrades central portions of the  .  For some ototoxic chemical exposures, particularly styrene,  the risk of hearing loss can be higher than being exposed to   alone. The effects is greatest when the combined exposure include  .  A 2018 informational bulletin by the US   (OSHA) and the   (NIOSH) introduces the issue, provides examples of ototoxic chemicals, lists the industries and occupations at risk and provides prevention information. \n There can be damage either to the ear, whether the external or middle ear, to the cochlea, or to the brain centers that process the aural information conveyed by the ears.  Damage to the middle ear may include fracture and discontinuity of the ossicular chain.   Damage to the inner ear (cochlea) may be caused by  .  People who sustain head injury are especially vulnerable to hearing loss or tinnitus, either temporary or permanent. \n Sound waves reach the outer ear and are conducted down the ear canal to the  , causing it to vibrate. The vibrations are transferred by the 3 tiny ear bones of the   to the fluid in the inner ear. The fluid moves hair cells ( ), and their movement generates nerve impulses which are then taken to the brain by the  .   The auditory nerve takes the impulses to the brainstem, which sends the impulses to the midbrain. Finally, the signal goes to the auditory cortex of the temporal lobe to be interpreted as sound. \n Hearing loss is most commonly caused by long-term exposure to loud noises, from recreation or from work, that damage the hair cells, which do not grow back on their own. \n Older people may lose their hearing from long exposure to noise, changes in the inner ear, changes in the middle ear, or from changes along the nerves from the ear to the brain. \n Identification of a hearing loss is usually conducted by a general practitioner  ,  , certified and licensed  , school or industrial  , or other audiometric technician. Diagnosis of the cause of a hearing loss is carried out by a specialist physician (audiovestibular physician) or  .\n Hearing loss is generally measured by playing generated or recorded sounds, and determining whether the person can hear them. Hearing sensitivity varies according to the   of sounds. To take this into account, hearing sensitivity can be measured for a range of frequencies and plotted on an  . Other method for quantifying hearing loss is a   using a mobile application or hearing aid application, which includes a hearing test.  Hearing diagnosis using mobile application is similar to the   procedure.  Audiograms, obtained using mobile applications, can be used to adjust hearing aid applications.  Another method for quantifying hearing loss is a speech-in-noise test. which gives an indication of how well one can understand speech in a noisy environment.  Otoacoustic emissions test is an objective hearing test that may be administered to toddlers and children too young to cooperate in a conventional hearing test. Auditory brainstem response testing is an electrophysiological test used to test for hearing deficits caused by pathology within the ear, the cochlear nerve and also within the brainstem.\n A case history (usually a written form, with questionnaire) can provide valuable information about the context of the hearing loss, and indicate what kind of diagnostic procedures to employ. Examinations include  ,  , and differential testing with the  ,  , Bing and Schwabach tests. In case of infection or inflammation, blood or other body fluids may be submitted for laboratory analysis.  MRI and CT scans can be useful to identify the pathology of many causes of hearing loss.\n Hearing loss is categorized by severity, type, and configuration. Furthermore, a hearing loss may exist in only one ear (unilateral) or in both ears (bilateral).  Hearing loss can be temporary or permanent, sudden or progressive. The   of a hearing loss is ranked according to ranges of nominal thresholds in which a sound must be so it can be detected by an individual. It is measured in   of hearing loss, or dB HL. There are three main   of hearing loss:  ,  , and mixed hearing loss.  An additional problem which is increasingly recognised is   which is not a hearing loss as such but a difficulty perceiving sound. The shape of an audiogram shows the relative   of the hearing loss, such as a   for otosclerosis, 'noise' notch for noise-induced damage, high frequency rolloff for presbycusis, or a flat audiogram for conductive hearing loss. In conjunction with speech audiometry, it may indicate central auditory processing disorder, or the presence of a   or other tumor.\n People with   or single-sided deafness (SSD) have difficulty in hearing conversation on their impaired side, localizing sound, and understanding speech in the presence of background noise.  One reason for the hearing problems these patients often experience is due to the  . \n Idiopathic sudden hearing loss is a condition where a person as an immediate decrease in the sensitivity of their   that does not have a known cause.  This type of loss is usually only on one side (unilateral) and the severity of the loss varies. A common threshold of a \"loss of at least 30 dB in three connected frequencies within 72 hours\" is sometimes used, however there is no universal definition or international consensus for diagnosing idiopathic sudden hearing loss.  \n It is estimated that half of cases of hearing loss are preventable.  About 60% of hearing loss in children under the age of 15 can be avoided.  There are a number of effective preventative strategies, including: immunization against   to prevent  , immunization against   and   to reduce cases of  , and avoiding or protecting against excessive noise exposure.  The   also recommends immunization against  ,  , and  , efforts to prevent  , and avoidance of certain medication as prevention.    is a yearly event to promote actions to prevent hearing damage.\n Avoiding exposure to loud noise can help prevent noise-induced hearing loss.  18% of adults exposed to loud noise at work for five years or more report hearing loss in both ears as compared to 5.5% of adults who were not exposed to loud noise at work.  Different programs exist for specific populations such as school-age children, adolescents and workers.  Education regarding noise exposure increases the use of hearing protectors.  But the HPD (without individual selection, training and  ) does not significantly reduce the risk of hearing loss.  The use of   is being studied for the prevention of noise-induced hearing loss, particularly for scenarios in which noise exposure cannot be reduced, such as during military operations. \n Noise is widely recognized as an  . In the United States, the   (NIOSH) and the   (OSHA) work together to provide standards and enforcement on workplace noise levels.  The   demonstrates the different levels of controls to reduce or eliminate exposure to noise and prevent hearing loss, including   and   (PPE).  Other programs and initiative have been created to prevent hearing loss in the workplace. For example, the   was created to recognize organizations that can demonstrate results of successful noise control and other interventions.  Additionally, the   program was created to encourage employers to purchase quieter machinery and tools.  By purchasing less noisy power tools like those found on the   and limiting exposure to ototoxic chemicals, great strides can be made in preventing hearing loss. \n Companies can also provide personal hearing protector devices tailored to both the worker and type of employment. Some hearing protectors universally block out all noise, and some allow for certain noises to be heard. Workers are more likely to wear hearing protector devices when they are properly fitted. \n Often interventions to prevent noise-induced hearing loss have many components. A 2017 Cochrane review found that stricter legislation might reduce noise levels.   Providing workers with information on their   was not shown to decrease exposure to noise. Ear protection, if used correctly, can reduce noise to safer levels, but often, providing them is not sufficient to prevent hearing loss. Engineering noise out and other solutions such as proper maintenance of equipment can lead to noise reduction, but further field studies on resulting noise exposures following such interventions are needed. Other possible solutions include improved enforcement of existing legislation and better implementation of well-designed prevention programmes, which have not yet been proven conclusively to be effective. The conclusion of the Cochrane Review was that further research could modify what is now regarding the effectiveness of the evaluated interventions. \n The   has created a hearing impairment calculator based on the ISO 1999 model for studying   in relatively homogeneous groups of people, such as workers with the same type of job.  The ISO 1999 model estimates how much hearing impairment in a group can be ascribed to age and  .  The result is calculated via an   that uses the A-weighted sound exposure level, how many years the people were exposed to this noise, how old the people are, and their sex. The model's estimations are only useful for people without hearing loss due to non-job related exposure and can be used for prevention activities. \n The   recommends   for all newborns, as the first three years of life are believed to be the most important for language development.  Universal neonatal hearing screenings have now been widely implemented across the U.S., with rates of newborn screening increasing from less than 3% in the early 1990s to 98% in 2009.  Newborns whose screening reveals a high index of suspicion of hearing loss are referred for additional diagnostic testing with the goal of providing early intervention and access to language.  \n The   advises that children should have their hearing tested several times throughout their schooling: \n While the American College of Physicians indicated that there is not enough evidence to determine the utility of screening in adults over 50 years old who do not have any symptoms,  the   recommends that adults should be screened at least every decade through age 50 and at three-year intervals thereafter, to minimize the detrimental effects of the untreated condition on quality of life.  For the same reason, the US Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion included as one of   objectives: to increase the proportion of persons who have had a hearing examination. \n Management depends on the specific cause if known as well as the extent, type and configuration of the hearing loss. Sudden hearing loss due to an underlying nerve problem may be treated with  . \n Most hearing loss, that result from age and noise, is progressive and irreversible, and there are currently no approved or recommended treatments.  A few specific kinds of hearing loss are amenable to surgical treatment.  In other cases, treatment is addressed to underlying pathologies, but any hearing loss incurred may be permanent. Some management options include  ,  ,  ,  , and  ;  in  , a Hearing Impaired (HI) audio track may be available via headphones to better hear dialog. \n This choice depends on the level of hearing loss, type of hearing loss, and personal preference. Hearing aid applications are one of the options for hearing loss management.  For people with bilateral hearing loss, it is not clear if bilateral hearing aids (hearing aids in both ears) are better than a unilateral hearing aid (hearing aid in one ear). \n For people with idiopathic sudden hearing loss, different treatment approaches have been suggested that are usually based on the suspected cause of the sudden hearing loss. Treatment approaches may include corticosteroid medications, rheological drugs, vasodilators, anesthetics, and other medications chosen based on the suspected underlying pathology that caused the sudden hearing loss.  The evidence supporting most treatment options for idiopathic sudden hearing loss is very weak and adverse effects of these different medications is a consideration when deciding on a treatment approach. \n Globally, hearing loss affects about 10% of the population to some degree.  It caused moderate to severe disability in 124.2 million people as of 2004 (107.9 million of whom are in low and middle income countries).  Of these 65 million acquired the condition during childhood.  At birth ~3 per 1000 in   and more than 6 per 1000 in   have hearing problems. \n Hearing loss increases with age. In those between 20 and 35 rates of hearing loss are 3% while in those 44 to 55 it is 11% and in those 65 to 85 it is 43%. \n A 2017 report by the World Health Organization estimated the costs of unaddressed hearing loss and the cost-effectiveness of interventions, for the health-care sector, for the education sector and as broad societal costs.   Globally, the annual cost of unaddressed hearing loss was estimated to be in the range of $750–790 billion  .\n The   (ISO) developed the ISO 1999 standards for the estimation of hearing thresholds and noise-induced hearing impairment.  They used data from two noise and hearing study databases, one presented by Burns and Robinson (  Her Majesty's Stationery Office,  London, 1970) and by Passchier-Vermeer (1968).  As race are some of the factors that can affect the expected distribution of pure-tone hearing thresholds several other national or regional datasets exist, from Sweden,   Norway,  South Korea,  the United States  and Spain. \n In the United States hearing is one of the health outcomes measure by the   (NHANES), a     program conducted by the  . It examines   and   status of adults and children in the  .  Data from the United States in 2011-2012 found that rates of hearing loss has declined among adults aged 20 to 69 years, when compared with the results from an earlier time period (1999-2004). It also found that adult hearing loss is associated with increasing age, sex, ethnicity, educational level, and noise exposure.   Nearly one in four adults had audiometric results suggesting noise-induced hearing loss. Almost one in four adults who reported excellent or good hearing had a similar pattern (5.5% on both sides and 18% on one side). Among people who reported exposure to loud noise at work, almost one third had such changes. \n People with extreme hearing loss may communicate through  . Sign languages convey meaning through manual communication and body language instead of acoustically conveyed sound patterns. This involves the simultaneous combination of hand shapes, orientation and movement of the hands, arms or body, and facial expressions to express a speaker's thoughts. \"Sign languages are based on the idea that vision is the most useful tool a deaf person has to communicate and receive information\". \n  refers to a tight-knit   of people whose   is signed, and who practice social and cultural norms which are distinct from those of the surrounding hearing community. This community does not automatically include all those who are clinically or legally deaf, nor does it exclude every hearing person. According to Baker and Padden, it includes any person or persons who \"identifies him/herself as a member of the Deaf community, and other members accept that person as a part of the community,\"  an example being   with normal hearing ability.  It includes the set of social beliefs, behaviors, art, literary traditions, history, values, and shared institutions of communities that are influenced by deafness and which use sign languages as the main means of communication.   Members of the Deaf community tend to view deafness as a difference in human experience rather than a   or  .   When used as a cultural label especially within the culture, the word   is often written with a capital   and referred to as \"big D Deaf\" in speech and sign. When used as a label for the   condition, it is written with a lower case  . \n There also multiple educational institutions for both deaf and Deaf people, that usually use sign language as the main language of instruction. Famous institutions include   and the   in the US,  and the   in Japan. \n A 2005 study achieved successful   in guinea pigs.  However, the regrowth of cochlear hair cells does not imply the restoration of hearing sensitivity, as the sensory cells may or may not make connections with neurons that carry the signals from hair cells to the brain. A 2008 study has shown that gene therapy targeting   can cause hair cell growth and attract neuronal processes in embryonic mice. Some hope that a similar treatment will one day ameliorate hearing loss in humans. \n Recent research, reported in 2012 achieved growth of cochlear nerve cells resulting in hearing improvements in gerbils,  using stem cells. Also reported in 2013 was regrowth of hair cells in deaf adult mice using a drug intervention resulting in hearing improvement.  The   in the US has embarked on a project called the Hearing Restoration Project.  Also Action on Hearing Loss in the UK is also aiming to restore hearing. \n Researchers reported in 2015 that genetically deaf mice which were treated with   gene therapy recovered some of their hearing.  In 2017, additional studies were performed to treat   and here, a recombinant adeno-associated virus seemed to outperform the older vectors. \n Besides research studies seeking to improve hearing, such as the ones listed above, research studies on the deaf have also been carried out in order to understand more about audition. Pijil and Shwarz (2005) conducted their study on the deaf who lost their hearing later in life and, hence, used cochlear implants to hear. They discovered further evidence for rate coding of pitch, a system that codes for information for frequencies by the rate that neurons fire in the auditory system, especially for lower frequencies as they are coded by the frequencies that neurons fire from the basilar membrane in a synchronous manner. Their results showed that the subjects could identify different pitches that were proportional to the frequency stimulated by a single electrode. The lower frequencies were detected when the basilar membrane was stimulated, providing even further evidence for rate coding. \n"},

Despite his short life, his rapid pace of composition resulted in   representing virtually every Western classical genre of his time. Many of these compositions are acknowledged as pinnacles of the  ,  ,  , operatic, and   repertoire. Mozart is widely regarded as being one of the greatest composers in the history of Western music,  with his music admired for its \"melodic beauty, its formal elegance and its richness of harmony and texture\". \n Born in  , then in the   and currently in  , Mozart showed   ability from his earliest childhood. At the age of five he was already competent on keyboard and violin, he had begun to compose, and he performed before European royalty. His father took him on a   of Europe and then  . At 17, he was a musician at the Salzburg court but grew restless and travelled in search of a better position.\n While visiting Vienna in 1781, Mozart was dismissed from his Salzburg position. He stayed in Vienna, where he achieved fame but little financial security. During his final years there, he composed many of his best-known  ,  , and  . His   was largely unfinished at the time of   at the age of 35, the circumstances of which are uncertain and much mythologised.\n Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was born on 27 January 1756 to   (1719–1787) and  , née Pertl (1720–1778), at   in Salzburg.  Salzburg was the capital of the  , an ecclesiastic principality in the   (today in  ).  He was the youngest of seven children, five of whom died in infancy. His elder sister was   (1751–1829), nicknamed \"Nannerl\". Mozart was baptised the day after his birth, at   in Salzburg. The baptismal record gives his name in Latinized form, as  . He generally called himself \"Wolfgang Amadè Mozart\"  as an adult, but   had many variants.\n Leopold Mozart, a native of  ,  then an Imperial Free City in the Holy Roman Empire, was a minor composer and an experienced teacher. In 1743, he was appointed as the fourth violinist in the musical establishment of Count  , the ruling  .  Four years later, he married Anna Maria in Salzburg. Leopold became the orchestra's deputy   in 1763. During the year of his son's birth, Leopold published a violin textbook,  , which achieved success. \n When Nannerl was seven, she began keyboard lessons with her father, while her three-year-old brother looked on. Years later, after her brother's death, she reminisced:\n He often spent much time at the  , picking out thirds, which he was ever striking, and his pleasure showed that it sounded good. ... In the fourth year of his age his father, for a game as it were, began to teach him a few minuets and pieces at the clavier. ... He could play it faultlessly and with the greatest delicacy, and keeping exactly in time. ... At the age of five, he was already composing little pieces, which he played to his father who wrote them down. These early pieces,   1–5, were recorded in the  . There is some scholarly debate about whether Mozart was four or five years old when he created his first musical compositions, though there is little doubt that Mozart composed his first three pieces of music within a few weeks of each other: K. 1a, 1b, and 1c. \n In his early years, Wolfgang's father was his only teacher. Along with music, he taught his children languages and academic subjects.  Biographer   notes that, while Leopold was a devoted teacher to his children, there is evidence that Mozart was keen to progress beyond what he was taught.  His first ink-spattered composition and his precocious efforts with the violin were of his initiative and came as a surprise to Leopold,  who eventually gave up composing when his son's musical talents became evident. \n While Wolfgang was young, his family made several European journeys in which he and Nannerl performed as  . These began with an exhibition in 1762 at the court of     of Bavaria in Munich, and at the Imperial Courts in Vienna and Prague. A long concert tour followed, spanning three and a half years, taking the family to the courts of Munich,  , Paris, London,  Dover, The Hague, Amsterdam, Utrecht,   and again to Paris, and back home via  ,  , and Munich.  During this trip, Wolfgang met many musicians and acquainted himself with the works of other composers. A particularly significant influence was  , whom he visited in London in 1764 and 1765. When he was eight years old, Mozart wrote  , most of which was probably transcribed by his father. \n The family trips were often challenging, and travel conditions were primitive.  They had to wait for invitations and reimbursement from the nobility, and they endured long, near-fatal illnesses far from home: first Leopold (London, summer 1764),  then both children (The Hague, autumn 1765).  The family again went to Vienna in late 1767 and remained there until December 1768.\n After one year in Salzburg, Leopold and Wolfgang set off for Italy, leaving Anna Maria and Nannerl at home. This tour lasted from December 1769 to March 1771. As with earlier journeys, Leopold wanted to display his son's abilities as a performer and a rapidly maturing composer. Wolfgang met   and   in   and was accepted as a member of the famous  . There exists a myth, according to which, while in Rome, he heard  's   twice in performance in the  . Allegedly, he subsequently wrote it out from memory, thus producing the \"first unauthorized copy of this closely guarded property of the  \". However, both origin and plausibility of this account are disputed. \n In Milan, Mozart wrote the opera   (1770), which was performed with success. This led to further opera  . He returned with his father twice to Milan (August–December 1771; October 1772 – March 1773) for the composition and premieres of   (1771) and   (1772). Leopold hoped these visits would result in a professional appointment for his son, and indeed ruling   contemplated hiring Mozart, but owing to his mother  's reluctance to employ \"useless people\", the matter was dropped  and Leopold's hopes were never realized.  Toward the end of the journey, Mozart wrote the solo    ,  165.\n After finally returning with his father from Italy on 13 March 1773, Mozart was employed as a court musician by the ruler of Salzburg,  . The composer had many friends and admirers in Salzburg  and had the opportunity to work in many genres, including symphonies, sonatas, string quartets,  , serenades, and a few minor operas. Between April and December 1775, Mozart developed an enthusiasm for violin concertos, producing a series of five (the only ones he ever wrote), which steadily increased in their musical sophistication. The last three— ,  ,  —are now staples of the repertoire. In 1776, he turned his efforts to  , culminating in the E  concerto   of early 1777, considered by critics to be a breakthrough work. \n Despite these artistic successes, Mozart grew increasingly discontented with Salzburg and redoubled his efforts to find a position elsewhere. One reason was his low salary, 150 florins a year;  Mozart longed to compose operas, and Salzburg provided only rare occasions for these. The situation worsened in 1775 when the court theatre was closed, especially since the other theatre in Salzburg was primarily reserved for visiting troupes. \n Two long expeditions in search of work interrupted this long Salzburg stay. Mozart and his father visited Vienna from 14 July to 26 September 1773, and Munich from 6 December 1774 to March 1775. Neither visit was successful, though the Munich journey resulted in a popular success with the premiere of Mozart's opera  . \n In August 1777, Mozart resigned his position at Salzburg  and on 23 September ventured out once more in search of employment, with visits to  , Mannheim, Paris, and Munich. \n Mozart became acquainted with members of the   in Mannheim, the best in Europe at the time. He also fell in love with  , one of four daughters of a musical family. There were prospects of employment in Mannheim, but they came to nothing,  and Mozart left for Paris on 14 March 1778  to continue his search. One of his letters from Paris hints at a possible post as an organist at  , but Mozart was not interested in such an appointment.  He fell into debt and took to pawning valuables.  The nadir of the visit occurred when Mozart's mother was taken ill and died on 3 July 1778.  There had been delays in calling a doctor—probably, according to Halliwell, because of a lack of funds.  Mozart stayed with   at  's residence, 5  . \n While Mozart was in Paris, his father was pursuing opportunities of employment for him in Salzburg.  With the support of the local nobility, Mozart was offered a post as court organist and concertmaster. The annual salary was 450 florins,  but he was reluctant to accept.  By that time, relations between Grimm and Mozart had cooled, and Mozart moved out. After leaving Paris in September 1778 for Strasbourg, he lingered in Mannheim and Munich, still hoping to obtain an appointment outside Salzburg. In Munich, he again encountered Aloysia, now a very successful singer, but she was no longer interested in him.  Mozart finally returned to Salzburg on 15 January 1779 and took up his new appointment, but his discontent with Salzburg remained undiminished. \n Among the better-known works which Mozart wrote on the Paris journey are the  , K. 310/300d, the   (No. 31), which were performed in Paris on 12 and 18 June 1778;  and the   in C major, K. 299/297c. \n In January 1781, Mozart's opera   premiered with \"considerable success\" in Munich.  The following March, Mozart was summoned to Vienna, where his employer, Archbishop Colloredo, was attending the celebrations for the accession of   to the Austrian throne. For Colloredo, this was simply a matter of wanting his musical servant to be at hand (Mozart indeed was required to dine in Colloredo's establishment with the valets and cooks).  He planned a bigger career as he continued in the archbishop's service;  for example, he wrote to his father:\n My main goal right now is to meet the emperor in some agreeable fashion, I am absolutely determined he  . I would be so happy if I could whip through my opera for him and then play a fugue or two, for that's what he likes. Mozart did indeed soon meet the Emperor, who eventually was to support his career substantially with commissions and a part-time position.\n In the same letter to his father just quoted, Mozart outlined his plans to participate as a soloist in the concerts of the  , a prominent benefit concert series;  this plan as well came to pass after the local nobility prevailed on Colloredo to drop his opposition. \n Colloredo's wish to prevent Mozart from performing outside his establishment was in other cases carried through, raising the composer's anger; one example was a chance to perform before the Emperor at  's for a fee equal to half of his yearly Salzburg salary.\n The quarrel with the archbishop came to a head in May: Mozart attempted to resign and was refused. The following month, permission was granted, but in a grossly insulting way: the composer was dismissed literally \"with a kick in the arse\", administered by the archbishop's steward, Count Arco. Mozart decided to settle in Vienna as a freelance performer and composer. \n The quarrel with Colloredo was more difficult for Mozart because his father sided against him. Hoping fervently that he would obediently follow Colloredo back to Salzburg, Mozart's father exchanged intense letters with his son, urging him to be reconciled with their employer. Mozart passionately defended his intention to pursue an independent career in Vienna. The debate ended when Mozart was dismissed by the archbishop, freeing himself both of his employer and of his father's demands to return. Solomon characterizes Mozart's resignation as a \"revolutionary step\" that significantly altered the course of his life. \n Mozart's new career in Vienna began well. He often performed as a pianist, notably in a competition before the Emperor with   on 24 December 1781,  and he soon \"had established himself as the finest keyboard player in Vienna\".  He also prospered as a composer, and in 1782 completed the opera   (\"The Abduction from the Seraglio\"), which premiered on 16 July 1782 and achieved considerable success. The work was soon being performed \"throughout German-speaking Europe\",  and thoroughly established Mozart's reputation as a composer.\n Near the height of his quarrels with Colloredo, Mozart moved in with the Weber family, who had moved to Vienna from Mannheim. The family's father, Fridolin, had died, and the Webers were now taking in lodgers to make ends meet. \n After failing to win the hand of Aloysia Weber, who was now married to the actor and artist  , Mozart's interest shifted to the third daughter of the family,  .\n The courtship did not go entirely smoothly; surviving correspondence indicates that Mozart and Constanze briefly broke up in April 1782, over an episode involving jealousy (Constanze had permitted another young man to measure her calves in a parlor game).  Mozart also faced a very difficult task getting permission for the marriage from his father,  . \n The marriage took place in an atmosphere of crisis.   suggests that eventually Constanze moved in with Mozart, which would have placed her in disgrace by the mores of the time.  Mozart wrote to Leopold on 31 July 1782, \"All the good and well-intentioned advice you have sent fails to address the case of a man who has already gone so far with a maiden. Further postponement is out of the question.\"  Heartz relates, \"Constanze's sister   had tearfully declared that her mother would send the police after Constanze if she did not return home [presumably from Mozart's apartment].\"  On 4 August, Mozart wrote to Baroness von Waldstätten, asking: \"Can the police here enter anyone's house in this way? Perhaps it is only a ruse of Madame Weber to get her daughter back. If not, I know no better remedy than to marry Constanze tomorrow morning or if possible today.\" \n The couple were finally married on 4 August 1782 in  , the day before his father's consenting letter arrived in the mail. In the marriage contract, Constanze \"assigns to her bridegroom five hundred gulden which ... the latter has promised to augment with one thousand gulden\", with the total \"to pass to the survivor\". Further, all joint acquisitions during the marriage were to remain the common property of both.  \n The couple had six children, of whom only two survived infancy: \n In 1782 and 1783, Mozart became intimately acquainted with the work of   and   as a result of the influence of  , who owned many manuscripts of the   masters. Mozart's study of these scores inspired compositions in Baroque style and later influenced his musical language, for example in   passages in   (\"The Magic Flute\") and the finale of  . \n In 1783, Mozart and his wife visited his family in Salzburg. His father and sister were cordially polite to Constanze, but the visit prompted the composition of one of Mozart's great liturgical pieces, the  . Though not completed, it was premiered in Salzburg, with Constanze singing a solo part. \n Mozart met   in Vienna around 1784, and the two composers became friends. When Haydn visited Vienna, they sometimes played together in an impromptu  . Mozart's   (K. 387, K. 421, K. 428, K. 458, K. 464, and K. 465) date from the period 1782 to 1785, and are judged to be a response to   set from 1781.  Haydn wrote, \"posterity will not see such a talent again in 100 years\"  and in 1785 told Mozart's father: \"I tell you before God, and as an honest man, your son is the greatest composer known to me by person and repute, he has taste and what is more the greatest skill in composition.\" \n From 1782 to 1785 Mozart mounted concerts with himself as a soloist, presenting three or four new piano concertos in each season. Since space in the theatres was scarce, he booked unconventional venues: a large room in the Trattnerhof apartment building, and the ballroom of the Mehlgrube restaurant.  The concerts were very popular, and   premiered there are still firm fixtures in his repertoire. Solomon writes that during this period, Mozart created \"a harmonious connection between an eager composer-performer and a delighted audience, which was given the opportunity of witnessing the transformation and perfection of a major musical genre\". \n With substantial returns from his concerts and elsewhere, Mozart and his wife adopted a more luxurious lifestyle. They moved to an expensive apartment, with a yearly rent of 460 florins.  Mozart bought a fine   from   for about 900 florins, and a   table for about 300.  The Mozarts sent their son   to an expensive boarding school  and kept servants. During this period Mozart saved little of his income. \n On 14 December 1784, Mozart became a  , admitted to the lodge Zur Wohltätigkeit (\"Beneficence\").  Freemasonry played an essential role in the remainder of Mozart's life: he attended meetings, a number of his friends were Masons, and on various occasions, he composed Masonic music, e.g. the  . \n Despite the great success of  , Mozart did little operatic writing for the next four years, producing only two unfinished works and the one-act  . He focused instead on his career as a piano soloist and writer of concertos. Around the end of 1785, Mozart moved away from keyboard writing  and began his famous operatic collaboration with the    . The year 1786 saw the successful premiere of   in Vienna. Its reception in   later in the year was even warmer, and this led to a second collaboration with Da Ponte: the opera  , which premiered in October 1787 to acclaim in Prague, but less success in Vienna during 1788.  The two are among Mozart's most famous works and are mainstays of operatic repertoire today, though at their premieres their musical complexity caused difficulty both for listeners and for performers. These developments were not witnessed by Mozart's father, who had died on 28 May 1787. \n In December 1787, Mozart finally obtained a steady post under aristocratic patronage. Emperor Joseph II appointed him as his \"chamber composer\", a post that had fallen vacant the previous month on the death of  . It was a part-time appointment, paying just 800 florins per year, and required Mozart only to compose dances for the annual balls in the   (see  ). This modest income became important to Mozart when hard times arrived. Court records show that Joseph aimed to keep the esteemed composer from leaving Vienna in pursuit of better prospects. \n In 1787, the young   spent several weeks in Vienna, hoping to study with Mozart.  No reliable records survive to indicate whether the   ever met.\n Toward the end of the decade, Mozart's circumstances worsened. Around 1786 he had ceased to appear frequently in public concerts, and his income shrank.  This was a difficult time for musicians in Vienna because of the  : both the general level of prosperity and the ability of the aristocracy to support music had declined. In 1788, Mozart saw a 66% decline in his income compared to his best years in 1781. \n By mid-1788, Mozart and his family had moved from central Vienna to the suburb of  .  Although it has been suggested that Mozart aimed to reduce his rental expenses by moving to a suburb, as he wrote in his letter to  , Mozart had not reduced his expenses but merely increased the housing space at his disposal.  Mozart began to borrow money, most often from his friend and fellow mason Puchberg; \"a pitiful sequence of letters pleading for loans\" survives.  Maynard Solomon and others have suggested that Mozart was suffering from depression, and it seems his musical output slowed.  Major works of the period include the last three symphonies (Nos.  ,  , and  , all from 1788), and the last of the three Da Ponte operas,  , premiered in 1790.\n Around this time, Mozart made some long journeys hoping to improve his fortunes, visiting Leipzig, Dresden, and Berlin in the spring of 1789, and  , Mannheim, and other German cities in 1790.\n Mozart's last year was, until his final illness struck, a time of high productivity—and by some accounts, one of personal recovery.  He composed a great deal, including some of his most admired works: the opera  ; the final piano concerto ( ); the   K. 622; the last in his series of string quintets ( ); the motet   K. 618; and the unfinished   K. 626.\n Mozart's financial situation, a source of anxiety in 1790, finally began to improve. Although the evidence is inconclusive,  it appears that wealthy patrons in Hungary and Amsterdam pledged annuities to Mozart in return for the occasional composition. He is thought to have benefited from the sale of dance music written in his role as Imperial chamber composer.  Mozart no longer borrowed large sums from Puchberg and began to pay off his debts. \n He experienced great satisfaction in the public success of some of his works, notably   (which was performed several times in the short period between its premiere and Mozart's death)  and the Little Masonic Cantata K. 623, premiered on 17 November 1791. \n Mozart fell ill while in Prague for the premiere, on 6 September 1791, of his opera  , which was written in that same year on commission for Emperor  's coronation festivities.  He continued his professional functions for some time and conducted the premiere of   on 30 September. His health deteriorated on 20 November, at which point he became bedridden, suffering from swelling, pain, and vomiting. \n Mozart was nursed in his final days by his wife and her youngest sister, and was attended by the family doctor, Thomas Franz Closset. He was mentally occupied with the task of finishing his  , but the evidence that he dictated passages to his student   is minimal. \n Mozart died in his home on 5 December 1791  (aged 35) at 12:55 am.  The   describes his funeral:\n Mozart was interred in a common grave, in accordance with contemporary Viennese custom, at the   outside the city on 7 December. If, as later reports say, no mourners attended, that too is consistent with Viennese burial customs at the time; later   (1856) wrote that  ,  ,   and two other musicians were present. The tale of a storm and snow is false; the day was calm and mild. The expression \"common grave\" refers to neither a communal grave nor a pauper's grave, but an individual grave for a member of the common people (i.e., not the aristocracy). Common graves were subject to excavation after ten years; the graves of aristocrats were not. \n The cause of Mozart's death is not known with certainty. The official record of   (\"severe miliary fever\", referring to a rash that looks like  ) is more a symptomatic description than a diagnosis. Researchers have suggested more than a hundred causes of death, including acute  ,    infection,   ,   ,  , and a rare   ailment. \n Mozart's modest funeral did not reflect his standing with the public as a composer; memorial services and concerts in Vienna and Prague were well attended. Indeed, in the period immediately after his death, his reputation rose substantially. Solomon describes an \"unprecedented wave of enthusiasm\"  for his work;   first by  ,  , and  , and publishers vied to produce complete editions of his works. \n Mozart's physical appearance was described by tenor   in his  : \"a remarkably small man, very thin and pale, with a profusion of fine, fair hair of which he was rather vain\". His early biographer Niemetschek wrote, \"there was nothing special about [his] physique. ... He was small and his countenance, except for his large intense eyes, gave no signs of his genius.\" His facial complexion was pitted, a reminder of his  .  Of his voice, his wife later wrote that it \"was a tenor, rather soft in speaking and delicate in singing, but when anything excited him, or it became necessary to exert it, it was both powerful and energetic.\" \n He loved elegant clothing. Kelly remembered him at a rehearsal:   was on the stage with his crimson   and gold-laced  , giving the time of the music to the orchestra.\" Based on paintings that researchers were able to find of Mozart, he seemed to wear a white wig for most of his formal occasions—researchers of the   declared that only one of his fourteen portraits they had found showed him without his wig. \n Mozart usually worked long and hard, finishing compositions at a tremendous pace as deadlines approached. He often made sketches and drafts; unlike Beethoven's, these are mostly not preserved, as his wife sought to destroy them after his death. \n Mozart lived at the center of the Viennese musical world, and knew a significant number and variety of people: fellow musicians, theatrical performers, fellow Salzburgers, and aristocrats, including some acquaintance with Emperor  . Solomon considers his three closest friends to have been Gottfried von Jacquin, Count August Hatzfeld, and Sigmund Barisani; others included his elder colleague  , singers   and  , and the horn player  . Leutgeb and Mozart carried on a kind of friendly mockery, often with Leutgeb as the butt of Mozart's  . \n He enjoyed  , dancing, and kept pets, including a canary, a  , a dog, and a horse for recreational riding.  He had a startling fondness for  , which is preserved in his surviving letters, notably those written to his cousin   around 1777–1778, and in his correspondence with his sister and parents.  Mozart also wrote scatological music, a series of   that he sang with his friends.  He had an ear for languages, and having traveled all over Europe as a boy, was fluent in Latin, Italian, and French in addition to his native Salzburg dialect of German. He possibly also understood and spoke some English, having jokingly written \"You are an ass\" after his 19-year-old student   made a thoughtless mistake on his exercise papers.  \n Mozart   and remained a devout member of the Church throughout his life.  He embraced the teachings of   in 1784. \n Mozart's music, like  's, stands as an archetype of the  . At the time he began composing, European music was dominated by the  , a reaction against the highly evolved intricacy of the  . Progressively, and in large part at the hands of Mozart himself, the   complexities of the late Baroque emerged once more, moderated and disciplined by new  , and adapted to a new aesthetic and social milieu. Mozart was a versatile composer, and wrote in every major genre, including  , opera, the solo concerto, chamber music including   and  , and the piano  . These forms were not new, but Mozart advanced their technical sophistication and emotional reach. He almost single-handedly developed and popularized the Classical  . He wrote a great deal of  , including large-scale  , as well as dances,  ,  , and other forms of light entertainment. \n The central traits of the Classical style are all present in Mozart's music. Clarity, balance, and transparency are the hallmarks of his work, but simplistic notions of its delicacy mask the exceptional power of his finest masterpieces, such as the   in C minor, K. 491; the   in G minor, K. 550; and the opera  .   makes the point forcefully:\n It is only through recognizing the violence and sensuality at the center of Mozart's work that we can make a start towards a comprehension of his structures and an insight into his magnificence. In a paradoxical way,  's superficial characterization of the   can help us to see Mozart's daemon more steadily. In all of Mozart's supreme expressions of suffering and terror, there is something shockingly voluptuous. During his last decade, Mozart frequently exploited   harmony. A notable instance is his   (1785), whose introduction abounds in chromatic suspensions, giving rise to the work's nickname, the \"Dissonance\" quartet.\n Mozart had a gift for absorbing and adapting the valuable features of others' music. His travels helped in the forging of a unique compositional language.  In London as a child, he met   and heard his music. In Paris, Mannheim, and Vienna he met with other compositional influences, as well as the avant-garde capabilities of the  . In Italy, he encountered the   and  , both of which deeply affected the evolution of his practice. In London and Italy, the   was in the ascendent: simple, light music with a mania for  ; an emphasis on tonic, dominant, and subdominant to the exclusion of other harmonies; symmetrical phrases; and clearly articulated partitions in the overall form of movements.  Some of Mozart's early symphonies are  , with three movements running into each other; many are   (all three movements having the same key signature, with the slow middle movement being in the  ). Others mimic the works of J. C. Bach, and others show the simple   turned out by Viennese composers.\n As Mozart matured, he progressively incorporated more features adapted from the Baroque. For example, the   K. 201 has a contrapuntal main theme in its first movement, and experimentation with irregular phrase lengths. Some of his quartets from 1773 have fugal finales, probably influenced by Haydn, who had included three such finales in his recently published   set. The influence of the   (\"Storm and Stress\") period in music, with its brief foreshadowing of the  , is evident in the music of both composers at that time. Mozart's   K. 183 is another excellent example.\n Mozart would sometimes switch his focus between operas and instrumental music. He produced operas in each of the prevailing styles:  , such as  ,  , and  ;  , such as  ; and  , of which   is the most famous example by any composer. In his later operas, he employed subtle changes in instrumentation, orchestral texture, and  , for emotional depth and to mark dramatic shifts. Here his advances in opera and instrumental composing interacted: his increasingly sophisticated use of the orchestra in the symphonies and concertos influenced his operatic orchestration, and his developing subtlety in using the orchestra to psychological effect in his operas was in turn reflected in his later non-operatic compositions. \n For unambiguous identification of works by Mozart, a   is used. This is a unique number assigned, in regular chronological order, to every one of his known works. A work is referenced by the abbreviation \"K.\" or \"KV\" followed by this number. The first edition of the catalogue was completed in 1862 by  . It has since been repeatedly updated, as scholarly research improves knowledge of the dates and authenticity of individual works. \n Although some of Mozart's early pieces were written for harpsichord, he also became acquainted in his early years with fortepianos made by   builder  . Later when Mozart was visiting Augsburg, he was impressed by   fortepianos and shared this in a letter to his father.  On 22 October 1777, Mozart had premiered  , K. 242, on instruments provided by Stein. The   organist Demmler was playing the first, Mozart the second and Stein the third part.  In 1783 when living in Vienna he purchased an instrument by  .  Leopold Mozart confirmed the attachment which Mozart had with his Walter fortepiano: \"It is impossible to describe the hustle and bustle. Your brother's pianoforte has been moved at least twelve times from his house to the theatre or to someone else's house.\" \n His most famous pupil was  ,  a   between the Classical and Romantic eras whom the Mozarts took into their Vienna home for two years as a child.  More important is the influence Mozart had on composers of later generations. Ever since the surge in his reputation after his death, studying his scores has been a standard part of classical musicians' training. \n , Mozart's junior by fifteen years, was deeply influenced by his work, with which he was acquainted as a teenager.  He is thought to have performed Mozart's operas while playing in the court orchestra at Bonn  and travelled to Vienna in 1787 hoping to study with the older composer. Some of   have direct models in comparable works by Mozart, and he wrote   (  58) to Mozart's D minor piano concerto  . \n Composers have paid homage to Mozart by writing sets of   on his themes. Beethoven wrote four such sets (Op. 66, WoO 28, WoO 40, WoO 46).  Others include  's   (1821),  's Variations on a Theme from Mozart's Opera   (1822),  's   from   (1827), and  's   (1914), based on the variation theme in the piano sonata  .   , who revered Mozart, wrote his Orchestral Suite No. 4 in G,   (1887), as a tribute to him. \n \n"},

His contributions to   have led him to be called \"Father of the  \" and \"Father of the  \". \n Haydn spent much of his career as a court musician for the wealthy   family at their   Castle. Until the later part of his life, this isolated him from other composers and trends in music so that he was, as he put it, \"forced to become original\".  Yet his music circulated widely, and for much of his career he was the most celebrated composer in Europe.\n He was  ,  , and the elder brother of composer  .\n Joseph Haydn was born in  ,  , a village that at that time stood on the border with Hungary.  His father was  , a   who also served as \"Marktrichter\", or marketplace supervisor. Haydn's mother Maria, née Koller, had previously worked as a cook in the palace of  , the presiding aristocrat of Rohrau. Neither parent could read music;  however, Mathias was an enthusiastic  , who during the   period of his career had taught himself to play the harp. According to Haydn's later reminiscences, his family was extremely musical, and they frequently sang together and with their neighbours. \n Haydn's parents had noticed that their son was musically gifted and knew that in Rohrau he would have no chance to obtain serious musical training. It was for this reason that, around the time Haydn turned six, they accepted a proposal from their relative Johann Matthias Frankh, the schoolmaster and choirmaster in  , that Haydn be apprenticed to Frankh in his home to train as a musician. Haydn therefore went off with Frankh to Hainburg and he never again lived with his parents.\n Life in the Frankh household was not easy for Haydn, who later remembered being frequently hungry  and humiliated by the filthy state of his clothing.  He began his musical training there, and could soon play both   and violin. He also sang   parts in the church  .\n There is reason to think that Haydn's singing impressed those who heard him, because in 1739  he was brought to the attention of  , the director of music in   in Vienna, who happened to be visiting Hainburg and was looking for new choirboys. Haydn passed his audition with Reutter, and after several months of further training moved to Vienna (1740), where he worked for the next nine years as a chorister. It is also popularly believed that Haydn sang at the funeral of   in 1741. \n Haydn lived in the Kapellhaus next to the cathedral, along with Reutter, Reutter's family, and the other four choirboys, which after 1745 included his younger brother  .  The choirboys were instructed in Latin and other school subjects as well as voice, violin, and keyboard.  Reutter was of little help to Haydn in the areas of   and composition, giving him only two lessons in his entire time as chorister.  However, since St. Stephen's was one of the leading musical centres in Europe, Haydn learned a great deal simply by serving as a professional musician there. \n Like Frankh before him, Reutter did not always bother to make sure Haydn was properly fed. As he later told his biographer  , Haydn was motivated to sing well, in hopes of gaining more invitations to perform before aristocratic audiences, where the singers were usually served refreshments. \n By 1749, Haydn had matured physically to the point that he was no longer able to sing high choral parts. Empress   herself complained to Reutter about his singing, calling it \"crowing\".  One day, Haydn carried out a prank, snipping off the pigtail of a fellow chorister.  This was enough for Reutter: Haydn was first  , then summarily dismissed and sent into the streets.  He had the good fortune to be taken in by a friend, Johann Michael Spangler,  who shared his family's crowded garret room with Haydn for a few months. Haydn immediately began his pursuit of a career as a freelance musician.\n Haydn struggled at first, working at many different jobs: as a music teacher, as a street serenader, and eventually, in 1752, as valet-accompanist for the Italian composer  , from whom he later said he learned \"the true fundamentals of composition\".  He was also briefly in  's employ, playing the organ in the Bohemian Chancellery chapel at the  . \n While a chorister, Haydn had not received any systematic training in music theory and composition. As a remedy, he worked his way through the   exercises in the text   by   and carefully studied the work of  , whom he later acknowledged as an important influence.  He said of CPE Bach's first six keyboard sonatas, \"I did not leave my clavier till I played them through, and whoever knows me thoroughly must discover that I owe a great deal to Emanuel Bach, that I understood him and have studied him with diligence.\" According to   and Dies, in the 1750s Haydn studied an encyclopedic treatise by  , a German composer. \n As his skills increased, Haydn began to acquire a public reputation, first as the composer of an opera,  , \"The Limping Devil\", written for the comic actor  , whose stage name was \"Bernardon\". The work was premiered successfully in 1753, but was soon closed down by the censors due to \"offensive remarks\".  Haydn also noticed, apparently without annoyance, that works he had simply given away were being published and sold in local music shops.  Between 1754 and 1756 Haydn also worked freelance for the court in Vienna. He was among several musicians who were paid for services as supplementary musicians at balls given for the imperial children during carnival season, and as supplementary singers in the imperial chapel (the  ) in Lent and Holy Week. \n With the increase in his reputation, Haydn eventually obtained aristocratic patronage, crucial for the career of a composer in his day. Countess Thun,  having seen one of Haydn's compositions, summoned him and engaged him as her singing and keyboard teacher.  In 1756, Baron Carl Josef Fürnberg employed Haydn at his country estate, Weinzierl, where the composer wrote his first string quartets. Of them, Philip G. Downs said \"they abound in novel effects and instrumental combinations that can only be the result of humorous intent\".  Their enthusiastic reception encouraged Haydn to write more. It was a turning point in his career. As a result of the performances, he became in great demand both as a performer and a teacher.  Fürnberg later recommended Haydn to  , who, in 1757,  became his first full-time employer.  His salary was a respectable 200 florins a year, plus free board and lodging. \n Haydn's job title under Count Morzin was  , that is, music director. He led the count's small orchestra in   and wrote his first symphonies for this ensemble – perhaps numbering in the double figures. Philip Downs comments of these first symphonies: \"the seeds of the future are there, his works already exhibit a richness and profusion of material, and a disciplined yet varied expression.\"  In 1760, with the security of a Kapellmeister position, Haydn married. His wife was the former Maria Anna Theresia Keller (1729–1800),  the sister of Therese (b. 1733), with whom Haydn had previously been in love. Haydn and his wife had a completely unhappy marriage,  from which time permitted no escape. They produced no children, and both took lovers. \n Count Morzin soon suffered financial reverses that forced him to dismiss his musical establishment, but Haydn was quickly offered a similar job (1761) by Prince  , head of the immensely wealthy  . Haydn's job title was only Vice-Kapellmeister, but he was immediately placed in charge of most of the Esterházy musical establishment, with the old Kapellmeister   retaining authority only for church music. When Werner died in 1766, Haydn was elevated to full Kapellmeister. \n As a \"house officer\" in the Esterházy establishment, Haydn wore   and followed the family as they moved among their various palaces, most importantly the family's ancestral seat   in   and later on  , a grand new palace built in rural Hungary in the 1760s. Haydn had a huge range of responsibilities, including composition, running the orchestra, playing   for and with his patrons, and eventually the mounting of operatic productions. Despite this backbreaking workload,  the job was in artistic terms a superb opportunity for Haydn.  The Esterházy princes (Paul Anton, then from 1762 to 1790  ) were musical connoisseurs who appreciated his work and gave him daily access to his own small orchestra. During the nearly thirty years that Haydn worked at the Esterházy court, he produced a flood of compositions, and his musical style continued to develop.\n Much of Haydn's activity at the time followed the musical taste of his patron Prince Nikolaus. In about 1765, the prince obtained and began to learn to play the  , an uncommon musical instrument similar to the bass  , but with a set of plucked  . Haydn was commanded to provide music for the prince to play, and over the next ten years produced about 200 works for this instrument in various ensembles, the most notable of which are the 126  . Around 1775, the prince abandoned the baryton and took up a new hobby: opera productions, previously a sporadic event for special occasions, became the focus of musical life at court, and the opera theater the prince had built at Esterháza came to host a major season, with multiple productions each year. Haydn served as company director, recruiting and training the singers and preparing and leading the performances. He wrote   and wrote substitution   to insert into the operas of other composers.\n 1779 was a watershed year for Haydn, as his contract was renegotiated: whereas previously all his compositions were the property of the Esterházy family, he now was permitted to write for others and sell his work to publishers. Haydn soon shifted his emphasis in composition to reflect this (fewer operas, and more quartets and symphonies) and he negotiated with multiple publishers, both Austrian and foreign. His new employment contract \"acted as a catalyst in the next stage in Haydn's career, the achievement of international popularity. By 1790 Haydn was in the paradoxical position ... of being Europe's leading composer, but someone who spent his time as a duty-bound Kapellmeister in a remote palace in the Hungarian countryside.\"  The new publication campaign resulted in the composition of a great number of new string quartets (the six-quartet sets of Op.  ,  , 54/55, and  ). Haydn also composed in response to commissions from abroad: the   (1785–1786) and the original orchestral version of   (1786), a commission from  , Spain.\n The remoteness of  , which was farther from Vienna than Eisenstadt, led Haydn gradually to feel more isolated and lonely.  He longed to visit Vienna because of his friendships there.  Of these, a particularly important one was with   (1754–1793), the wife of Prince Nikolaus's personal physician in Vienna, who began a close, platonic relationship with the composer in 1789. Haydn wrote to Mrs. Genzinger often, expressing his loneliness at Esterháza and his happiness for the few occasions on which he was able to visit her in Vienna. Later on, Haydn wrote to her frequently from London. Her premature death in 1793 was a blow to Haydn, and his   for piano, Hob. XVII:6, may have been written in response to her death. \n Another friend in Vienna was  , whom   sometime around 1784. According to later testimony by   and others, the two composers occasionally played in   with   (second violin) and   (cello) for small gatherings attended by   and  .  Impressed by Mozart's work, Haydn praised it unstintingly to others. Mozart returned the esteem in his  . In 1785 Haydn was admitted to the same   as Mozart, the \" \" in Vienna. \n In 1790, Prince Nikolaus died and was succeeded as prince by his son  . Following a trend of the time,  Anton sought to economize by dismissing most of the court musicians. Haydn retained a nominal appointment with Anton, at a reduced salary of 400 florins, as well as a 1000-florin pension from Nikolaus.  Since Anton had little need of Haydn's services, he was willing to let him travel, and the composer accepted a lucrative offer from  , a German violinist and  , to visit England and conduct new symphonies with a large orchestra.\n The choice was a sensible one because Haydn was already a very popular composer there. Since the death of   in 1782, Haydn's music had dominated the concert scene in London; \"hardly a concert did not feature a work by him\".  Haydn's work was widely distributed by publishers in London, including Forster (who had their own contract with Haydn) and Longman &   (who served as agent in England for Haydn's Vienna publisher  ).  Efforts to bring Haydn to London had been made since 1782, though Haydn's loyalty to Prince Nikolaus had prevented him from accepting. \n After fond farewells from Mozart and other friends,  Haydn departed from Vienna with Salomon on 15 December 1790, arriving in   in time to cross the English Channel on New Year's Day of 1791. It was the first time that the 58-year-old composer had seen the sea. Arriving in London, Haydn stayed with Salomon in Great Pulteney Street (London, near  )  working in a borrowed studio at the   piano firm nearby. \n It was the start of a very auspicious period for Haydn: both the 1791–1792 journey, along with a repeat visit in 1794–1795, were greatly successful. Audiences flocked to Haydn's concerts; he augmented his fame and made large profits, thus becoming financially secure.    reviewed the first concert thus: \"Haydn himself presided at the piano-forte; and the sight of that renowned composer so electrified the audience, as to excite an attention and a pleasure superior to any that had ever been caused by instrumental music in England.\"  Haydn made many new friends and, for a time, was involved in a romantic relationship with  .\n Musically, Haydn's visits to England generated some of his best-known work, including the  ,  ,   and   symphonies; the   quartet; and the   piano trio. The great success of the overall enterprise does not mean that the journeys were free of trouble. Notably, his very first project, the commissioned opera   was duly written during the early stages of the trip, but the opera's impresario   was unable to obtain a license to permit opera performances in the theatre he directed, the  . Haydn was well paid for the opera (£300) but much time was wasted.  Thus only two new symphonies,   and  , could be premiered in the 12 concerts of Salomon's spring concert series in 1791. Another problem arose from the jealously competitive efforts of a senior, rival orchestra, the  , who recruited Haydn's old pupil   as a rival visiting composer; the two composers, refusing to play along with the concocted rivalry, dined together and put each other's symphonies on their concert programs.\n The end of Salomon's series in June gave Haydn a rare period of relative leisure. He spent some of the time in the country ( ),  but also had time to travel, notably to Oxford, where he was awarded an honorary doctorate by the university. The symphony performed for the occasion,   has since come to be known as the  , although it had been written two years before, in 1789.  Four further new symphonies (Nos.  ,  ,   and  ) were performed in early 1792.\n While traveling to London in 1790, Haydn had met the young   in his native city of  . On Haydn's return, Beethoven came to Vienna and   up until the second London journey. Haydn took Beethoven with him to   for the summer, where Haydn had little to do, and taught Beethoven some  .  While in Vienna, Haydn purchased a house for himself and his wife in the suburbs and started remodeling it. He also arranged for the performance of some of his London symphonies in local concerts.\n By the time he arrived on his second journey to England (1794–1795), Haydn had become a familiar figure on the London concert scene. The 1794 season was dominated by Salomon's ensemble, as the Professional Concerts had abandoned their efforts. The concerts included the premieres of the 99th, 100th, and 101st symphonies. For 1795, Salomon had abandoned his own series, citing difficulty in obtaining \"vocal performers of the first rank from abroad\", and Haydn joined forces with the Opera Concerts, headed by the violinist  . These were the venue of the last three symphonies, 102, 103, and 104. The final benefit concert for Haydn (\"Dr. Haydn's night\") at the end of the 1795 season was a great success and was perhaps the peak of his English career. Haydn's biographer   wrote that Haydn \"considered the days spent in England the happiest of his life. He was everywhere appreciated there; it opened a new world to him\". \n Haydn returned to Vienna in 1795. Prince Anton had died, and his successor   proposed that the Esterházy musical establishment be revived with Haydn serving again as Kapellmeister. Haydn took up the position on a part-time basis. He spent his summers with the Esterházys in Eisenstadt, and over the course of several years wrote six   for them including the   in 1798.\n By this time Haydn had become a public figure in Vienna. He spent most of his time in his home, a large house in the suburb of Windmühle,  and wrote works for public performance. In collaboration with his librettist and mentor  , and with funding from van Swieten's  , he composed his two great oratorios,   (1798) and   (1801). Both were enthusiastically received. Haydn frequently appeared before the public, often leading performances of   and   for charity benefits, including   programs with massed musical forces. He also composed instrumental music: the popular  , and the last nine in his long series of string quartets, including the  ,  , and  . Directly inspired by hearing audiences sing   in London, in 1797 Haydn wrote a patriotic \"Emperor's Hymn\" \" \", (\"God Save Emperor Francis\"). This achieved great success and became \"the enduring emblem of Austrian identity right up to the First World War\" (Jones).  The melody was used for von Fallersleben's   (1841), which was written as part of the German unification movement and whose third stanza is today the   of the Federal Republic of Germany. (Modern Austria uses a  .)\n During the later years of this successful period, Haydn faced incipient old age and fluctuating health, and he had to struggle to complete his final works. His last major work, from 1802, was the sixth mass for the Esterházys, the  .\n By the end of 1803, Haydn's condition had declined to the point that he became physically unable to compose. He suffered from weakness, dizziness, inability to concentrate and painfully swollen legs. Since diagnosis was uncertain in Haydn's time, it is unlikely that the precise illness can ever be identified, though   suggests  .  The illness was especially hard for Haydn because the flow of fresh musical ideas continued unabated, although he could no longer work them out as compositions.  His biographer Dies reported Haydn saying in 1806:\n I must have something to do—usually musical ideas are pursuing me, to the point of torture, I cannot escape them, they stand like walls before me. If it's an   that pursues me, my pulse keeps beating faster, I can get no sleep. If it's an  , then I notice my pulse beating slowly. My imagination plays on me as if I were a clavier.\"  Haydn smiled, the blood rushed to his face, and he said \"I am really just a living clavier. The winding down of Haydn's career was gradual. The Esterházy family kept him on as Kapellmeister to the very end (much as they had with his predecessor Werner long before), but they  appointed new staff to lead their musical establishment: Johann Michael Fuchs in 1802 as Vice-Kapellmeister  and   as Konzertmeister in 1804.  Haydn's last summer in Eisenstadt was in 1803,  and his last appearance before the public as a conductor was a charity performance of   on 26 December 1803. As debility set in, he made largely futile efforts at composition, attempting to revise a rediscovered   from his teenage years and complete his  . The former project was abandoned for good in 1805, and the quartet was published with just two movements. \n Haydn was well cared for by his servants, and he received many visitors and public honors during his last years, but they could not have been very happy years for him.  During his illness, Haydn often found solace by sitting at the piano and playing his \" \". A final triumph occurred on 27 March 1808 when a performance of   was organized in his honour. The very frail composer was brought into the hall on an armchair to the sound of trumpets and drums and was greeted by Beethoven,   (who led the performance) and by other musicians and members of the aristocracy. Haydn was both moved and exhausted by the experience and had to depart at intermission. \n Haydn lived on for 14 more months. His final days were hardly serene, as in May 1809 the French army under   launched an attack on Vienna and on 10 May bombarded his neighborhood. According to Griesinger, \"Four   fell, rattling the windows and doors of his house. He called out in a loud voice to his alarmed and frightened people, 'Don't be afraid, children, where Haydn is, no harm can reach you!'. But the spirit was stronger than the flesh, for he had hardly uttered the brave words when his whole body began to tremble.\"  More bombardments followed until the city fell to the French on 13 May.  Haydn, was, however, deeply moved and appreciative when on 17 May a French cavalry officer named Sulémy came to pay his respects and sang, skillfully, an aria from  . \n On 26 May Haydn played his \"Emperor's Hymn\" with unusual gusto three times; the same evening he collapsed and was taken to what proved to be to his deathbed.  He died peacefully in his own home at 12:40 a.m. on 31 May 1809, aged 77.  On 15 June, a memorial service was held in the   at which Mozart's   was performed. Haydn's remains were interred in the local   until 1820, when they were moved to Eisenstadt by Prince Nikolaus. His head took a different journey;   by   shortly after burial, and the skull was reunited with the other remains only in 1954, now interred in a tomb in the north tower of the  .\n  writes of Haydn's public character thus: \"Haydn's public life exemplified the   ideal of the   ( ): the man whose good character and worldly success enable and justify each other. His modesty and probity were everywhere acknowledged. These traits were not only prerequisites to his success as  , entrepreneur and public figure, but also aided the favorable reception of his music.\"  Haydn was especially respected by the Esterházy court musicians whom he supervised, as he maintained a cordial working atmosphere and effectively represented the musicians' interests with their employer; see   and the tale of the  . Haydn had a robust sense of humor, evident in his love of practical jokes  and often apparent in his music, and he had many friends. For much of his life he benefited from a \"happy and naturally cheerful temperament\",  but in his later life, there is evidence for periods of depression, notably in the correspondence with   and in Dies's biography, based on visits made in Haydn's old age.\n Haydn was a devout Catholic who often turned to his   when he had trouble composing, a practice that he usually found to be effective.  He normally began the manuscript of each composition with   [in the name of the Lord] and ended with   [praise be to God].  He retained this practice even in his secular works; he frequently only uses the initials \"L. D.\", \"S. D. G.\" [ ], or   [... and to  ] and sometimes adds, \"et om  si  \" (  – and all saints) \n Haydn's early years of poverty and awareness of the financial precariousness of musical life made him astute and even sharp in his business dealings. Some contemporaries (usually, it has to be said, wealthy ones) were surprised and even shocked at this. Webster writes: \"As regards money, Haydn…always attempted to maximize his income, whether by negotiating the right to sell his music outside the Esterházy court, driving hard bargains with publishers or selling his works three and four times over [to publishers in different countries]; he regularly engaged in 'sharp practice'\" which nowadays might be regarded as plain fraud.  But those were days when copyright was in its infancy, and the pirating of musical works was common. Publishers had few qualms about attaching Haydn's name to popular works by lesser composers, an arrangement that effectively robbed the lesser musician of livelihood. Webster notes that Haydn's ruthlessness in business might be viewed more sympathetically in light of his struggles with poverty during his years as a freelancer—and that outside the world of business, in his dealings, for example, with relatives, musicians and servants, and in volunteering his services for charitable concerts, Haydn was a generous man – e.g., offering to teach the two infant sons of Mozart for free after their father's death.  When Haydn died he was certainly comfortably off, but by middle class rather than aristocratic standards.\n Haydn was short in stature, perhaps as a result of having been underfed throughout most of his youth. He was not handsome, and like many in his day he was a survivor of  ; his face was pitted with the scars of this disease.  His biographer   wrote: \"he couldn't understand how it happened that in his life he had been loved by many a pretty woman. 'They couldn't have been led to it by my beauty. \" \n His nose, large and aquiline, was disfigured by the   he suffered during much of his adult life,  an agonizing and debilitating disease that at times prevented him from writing music. \n James Webster summarizes Haydn's role in the history of classical music as follows: \n He excelled in every musical genre. [...] He is familiarly known as the \"father of the symphony\" because he composed 107 symphonies,  and could with greater justice be thus regarded for the string quartet; no other composer approaches his combination of productivity, quality and historical importance in these genres. A central characteristic of Haydn's music is the development of larger structures out of very short, simple musical  , often derived from standard accompanying figures. The music is often quite formally concentrated, and the important musical events of a movement can unfold rather quickly. \n Haydn's work was central to the development of what came to be called  . His practice, however, differed in some ways from that of   and  , his younger contemporaries who likewise excelled in this form of composition. Haydn was particularly fond of the so-called  , in which the music that establishes the dominant key is similar or identical to the opening theme. Haydn also differs from Mozart and Beethoven in his   sections, where he often rearranges the order of themes compared to the exposition and uses extensive  . \n Haydn's formal inventiveness also led him to integrate the   into the classical style and to enrich the rondo form with more cohesive tonal logic (see  ). Haydn was also the principal exponent of the   form—variations on two alternating themes, which are often major- and minor-mode versions of each other.\n Perhaps more than any other composer's, Haydn's music is known for its humor.  The most famous example is the sudden loud chord in the slow movement of his  ; Haydn's many other musical jokes include numerous   (e.g., in the quartets   and  ), and the remarkable rhythmic illusion placed in the trio section of the third movement of  . \n Much of the music was written to please and delight a prince, and its emotional tone is correspondingly upbeat.  This tone also reflects, perhaps, Haydn's fundamentally healthy and well-balanced personality. Occasional minor-key works, often deadly serious in character, form striking exceptions to the general rule. Haydn's fast movements tend to be rhythmically propulsive and often impart a great sense of energy, especially in the finales. Some characteristic examples of Haydn's \"rollicking\" finale type are found in the  , the String Quartet Op. 50 No. 1, and the Piano Trio Hob XV: 27. Haydn's early slow movements are usually not too slow in tempo, relaxed, and reflective. Later on, the emotional range of the slow movements increases, notably in the deeply felt slow movements of the quartets  , the   and  , and the Piano Trio Hob XV: 23. The   tend to have a strong downbeat and a clearly popular character. Over time, Haydn turned some of his minuets into \" \" which are much faster, at one beat to the bar.\n One of the most apt tributes to Haydn was spoken by the poet  . Keats, dying of tuberculosis, was brought to Rome by his friends in November 1820, in the hope that the climate might help to mitigate his suffering. (The poet died a few weeks later on 23 February 1821, at the age of 25.) According to his friend  : \n About this time he expressed a strong desire that we had a pianoforte, so that I might play to him, for not only was he passionately fond of music, but found that his constant pain and o'erfretted nerves were much soothed by it. This I managed to obtain on loan, and Dr. Clark procured me many volumes and pieces of music, and Keats had thus a welcome solace in the dreary hours he had to pass. Among the volumes was one of Haydn's Symphonies, and these were his delight, and he would exclaim enthusiastically, 'This Haydn is like a child, for there is no knowing what he will do next.' Haydn's early work dates from a period in which the compositional style of the High   (seen in   and  ) had gone out of fashion. This was a period of exploration and uncertainty, and Haydn, born 18 years before the death of Bach, was himself one of the musical explorers of this time.  An older contemporary whose work Haydn acknowledged as an important influence was  . \n Tracing Haydn's work over the six decades in which it was produced (roughly from 1749 to 1802), one finds a gradual but steady increase in complexity and musical sophistication, which developed as Haydn learned from his own experience and that of his colleagues. Several important landmarks have been observed in the evolution of Haydn's musical style.\n In the late 1760s and early 1770s, Haydn entered a stylistic period known as \" \" (\"storm and stress\"). This term is taken from   of about the same time, though it appears that the musical development actually preceded the literary one by a few years.  The musical language of this period is similar to what went before, but it is deployed in work that is more intensely expressive, especially in the works in minor keys. James Webster describes the works of this period as \"longer, more passionate, and more daring\".  Some of the most famous compositions of this time are the  ,  , the Piano Sonata in C minor (Hob. XVI/20, L. 33), and the  , all from c. 1771–72. It was also around this time that Haydn became interested in writing   in the Baroque style, and three of the Op. 20 quartets end with a fugue.\n Following the climax of the \"Sturm und Drang\", Haydn returned to a lighter, more overtly entertaining style. There are no quartets from this period, and the symphonies take on new features: the scoring often includes trumpets and  . These changes are often related to a major shift in Haydn's professional duties, which moved him away from \"pure\" music and toward the production of  . Several of the operas were Haydn's own work (see  ); these are seldom performed today. Haydn sometimes recycled his opera music in symphonic works,  which helped him continue his career as a symphonist during this hectic decade.\n In 1779, an important change in Haydn's contract permitted him to publish his compositions without prior authorization from his employer. This may have encouraged Haydn to rekindle his career as a composer of \"pure\" music. The change made itself felt most dramatically in 1781, when Haydn published the  , announcing (in a letter to potential purchasers) that they were written in \"a new and completely special way\".    has argued that this assertion on Haydn's part was not just sales talk but meant quite seriously, and he points out a number of important advances in Haydn's compositional technique that appear in these quartets, advances that mark the advent of the   style in full flower. These include a fluid form of phrasing, in which each motif emerges from the previous one without interruption, the practice of letting accompanying material evolve into melodic material, and a kind of \"Classical  \" in which each instrumental part maintains its own integrity. These traits continue in the many quartets that Haydn wrote after Op. 33. \n In the 1790s, stimulated by his England journeys, Haydn developed what Rosen calls his \"popular style\", a method of composition that, with unprecedented success, created music having great popular appeal but retaining a learned and rigorous musical structure.  An important element of the popular style was the frequent use of   or folk-like material (see  ). Haydn took care to deploy this material in appropriate locations, such as the endings of sonata expositions or the opening themes of finales. In such locations, the folk material serves as an element of stability, helping to anchor the larger structure.  Haydn's popular style can be heard in virtually all of his later work, including the twelve  , the late quartets and piano trios, and the two late  .\n The return to Vienna in 1795 marked the last turning point in Haydn's career. Although his musical style evolved little, his intentions as a composer changed. While he had been a servant, and later a busy entrepreneur, Haydn wrote his works quickly and in profusion, with frequent deadlines. As a rich man, Haydn now felt that he had the privilege of taking his time and writing for posterity. This is reflected in the subject matter of   (1798) and   (1801), which address such weighty topics as the meaning of life and the purpose of humankind and represent an attempt to render the sublime in music. Haydn's new intentions also meant that he was willing to spend much time on a single work: both oratorios took him over a year to complete. Haydn once remarked that he had worked on   so long because he wanted it to last. \n The change in Haydn's approach was important in the  , as other composers were soon following his lead. Notably, Beethoven adopted the practice of taking his time and aiming high. \n  prepared a comprehensive catalogue of Haydn's works. The   assigns a catalog number to each work, called its Hoboken number (abbreviated H. or Hob.). These Hoboken numbers are often used in identifying Haydn's compositions.\n Haydn's string quartets also have Hoboken numbers, but they are usually identified instead by their  , which have the advantage of indicating the groups of six quartets that Haydn published together. For example, the string quartet   is the third of the six quartets published in 1799 as Opus 76.\n An \"  in Wien\" fortepiano used by the composer is now on display in  .  In Vienna in 1788 Haydn bought himself a fortepiano made by Wenzel Schantz. When the composer was visiting London for the first time, an English piano builder,  , supplied him with a concert grand. \n \n \n \n \n \n"},
{"title": null, "content": "\n  is a stylistic movement in   associated with the period of the 19th century commonly referred to as the   (or Romantic period). It is closely related to the broader concept of  —the intellectual, artistic, and literary movement that became prominent in Western culture from about 1798 until 1837. \n Romantic composers sought to create music that was individualistic, emotional, dramatic, and often  ; reflecting broader trends within the movements of Romantic  ,  , art, and philosophy. Romantic music was often ostensibly inspired by (or else sought to evoke) non-musical stimuli, such as nature,  literature,  poetry,  super-natural elements, or the fine arts. It included features such as increased   and moved away from traditional forms. \n The Romantic movement was an artistic, literary, and intellectual movement that originated in the second half of the 18th century in Europe and strengthened in reaction to the  .  In part, it was a revolt against social and political norms of the   and a reaction against the scientific   of nature ( ). It was embodied most strongly in the visual arts, music, literature,  and education,  and was in turn influenced by developments in natural history. \n One of the first significant applications of the term to music was in 1789, in the   by the Frenchman  , but it was   who established the principles of musical romanticism, in a lengthy review of  's   published in 1810, and an 1813 article on Beethoven's instrumental music. In the first of these essays Hoffmann traced the beginnings of musical Romanticism to the later works of   and  . It was Hoffmann's fusion of ideas already associated with the term \"Romantic\", used in opposition to the restraint and formality of Classical models, that elevated music, and especially instrumental music, to a position of pre-eminence in Romanticism as the art most suited to the expression of emotions. It was also through the writings of Hoffmann and other German authors that German music was brought to the center of musical Romanticism. \n The classical period often used short, even fragmentary, thematic material while the Romantic period tended to make greater use of longer, more fully defined and more emotionally evocative themes. \n Characteristics often attributed to Romanticism:\n In music, there is a relatively clear dividing line in musical structure and form following the death of Beethoven. Whether one counts Beethoven as a \"romantic\" composer or not, the breadth and power of his work gave rise to a feeling that the classical   and, indeed, the structure of the symphony, sonata and string quartet had been exhausted. \n Events and changes in society such as ideas, attitudes, discoveries, inventions, and historical events often affect music. For example, the   was in full effect by the late 18th century and early 19th century. This event profoundly affected music: there were major improvements in the mechanical valves and keys that most woodwinds and brass instruments depend on. The new and innovative instruments could be played with greater ease and they were more reliable. \n Another development that affected music was the rise of the middle class.  Composers before this period lived under the   of the aristocracy. Many times their audience was small, composed mostly of the upper class and individuals who were knowledgeable about music.  The Romantic composers, on the other hand, often wrote for public concerts and festivals, with large audiences of paying customers, who had not necessarily had any music lessons.  Composers of the Romantic Era, like  , showed the world that there should be \"no segregation of musical tastes\"  and that the \"purpose was to write music that was to be heard\". \n \"The music composed by Romantic [composers]\" reflected \"the importance of the individual\" by being composed in ways that were often less restrictive and more often focused on the composer's skills as a person than prior means of writing music. \n During the Romantic period, music often took on a much more nationalistic purpose. Composers composed with a distinct sound that represented their home country and traditions. For example, Jean Sibelius'   has been interpreted to represent the rising nation of Finland, which would someday gain independence from Russian control. \n Frédéric Chopin was one of the first composers to incorporate nationalistic elements into his compositions. Joseph Machlis states, \"Poland's struggle for freedom from tsarist rule aroused the national poet in Poland. ... Examples of musical nationalism abound in the output of the romantic era. The folk idiom is prominent in the Mazurkas of Chopin\".  His mazurkas and polonaises are particularly notable for their use of nationalistic rhythms. Moreover, \"During World War II the Nazis forbade the playing of ... Chopin's Polonaises in Warsaw because of the powerful symbolism residing in these works\". \n Other composers, such as  , wrote pieces that musically described their homelands. In particular, Smetana's   is a   about the   in the modern-day  , the second in a cycle of six nationalistic symphonic poems collectively titled   (My Homeland).  Smetana also composed eight nationalist operas, all of which remain in the repertory. They established him as the first Czech nationalist composer as well as the most important Czech opera composer of the generation who came to prominence in the 1860s. \n The transition of   to Romanticism can be found in the work of  . Many typically romantic elements are encountered for the first time in his works. These works stand here in contrast to   and are \"prete\" instrumental music. According to Hoffmann, the pure   of Viennese classical music, especially that of  , since it is free of material or program, is the embodiment of the romantic art idea.  Another one of the most important representatives of early romanticism is  . Because only with him did romantic features come into the German-language opera with his   and later also  . In this field, his work is supplemented by the ballads of  .   is important for the development of the  , especially with his popular Freischütz. In addition, there are fantastic-horrious materials by   and finally the cheerful opera by  , while   became known mainly for his instrumental music. Still largely attached to classical music is the work of  ,  , and the Frenchman  .\n  experienced the heyday of the   opera in early Romanticism, associated with the names of  ,  , and  . While Rossini's comic operas are primarily known today, often only through their rousing  , Donizetti and Bellini predominate tragic content. The most important Italian instrumental composer of this time was the legendary \"devil's violinist\"  .\nIn  , on the one hand, the light Opéra comique developed, its representatives are  ,  , and  , the latter also known for his  . One can also quote the famous eccentric composer and harpist   (seven operas). In addition, the Grand opéra came up with pompous stage sets, ballets and large choirs. Her first representative was  , her most important  .\n Music development has now also taken an upswing in other European countries. The Irishman   composed the first   for  ,   worked in Denmark and the Swede   wrote four very idiosyncratic  .\n The high romanticism can be divided into two phases. In the first phase, the actual romantic music reaches its peak. The Polish composer   explored previously unknown depths of emotion in his character pieces and dances for piano.  , mentally immersed at the end of his life, represents in person as well as in music almost the prototype of the passionate romantic artist, shadowed by tragedy. His idiosyncratic piano pieces, chamber music works and symphonies should have a lasting influence on the following generation of musicians.\n , who came from the German minority in Hungary, was on the one hand a swarmed piano virtuoso, but on the other hand also laid the foundation for the progressive \" \" with his harmoniously bold  . Also committed to program music was the technique of the   (leitmotif) of the Frenchman  , who also significantly expanded the orchestra.   was again more oriented towards the classicist formal language and became a role model especially for   composers such as the Dane  .\nIn opera, the operas of   and   still dominated in Germany when   wrote his first romantic operas. The early works of   were also still based on the Belcanto ideal of the older generation. In France, the   was developed by   and  .   found its own language in the operas of   and  .\n The second phase of high romanticism runs in parallel with the style of realism in literature and the visual arts. In the second half of his creation, Wagner now developed his  , with which he holds together the four-part  , composed without  ; the orchestra is treated symphonically, the chromaticism reaches its extreme in  . A whole crowd of disciples is under the influence of Wagner's progressive ideas, among them, for example,  . On the other hand, an opposition arose from numerous more conservative composers, to whom  , who sought a logical continuation of classical music in symphony,   and song, became a model of scale due to the depth of the sensation and a masterful  . Among others,  ,  ,  ,  ,  , and   are included in this party.\n In addition, some important loners came on the scene, among whom   particularly stands out. Although a Wagner supporter, his clear-form style differs significantly from that of that composer. For example, the block-based instrumentation of Bruckner's symphonies is derived from the registers of the organ. In the ideological struggle against Wagner's adversaries, he was portrayed by his followers as a counterpart of Brahms.  , who originally wrote \"future music in classical form\" starting from Liszt, also stands between the parties in composition.\n Verdi also reached the way to a well-composed  , albeit in a different way than Wagner. His immense charisma made all other composers fade in Italy, including   and  , who was also the librettist of his late operas Otello and Falstaff.\nIn France, on the other hand, the light muse triumphed first in the form of the socio-critical   of  . Lyrical opera found its climax in the works of  , while in the Carmen by  , realism came for the first time.   built a stylistic bridge to German music. The operas, symphonies and chamber music works of the extremely versatile   were, as were the ballets of  , more tradition-oriented. New orchestra colors were found in the compositions of   and  . The Belgian-born   was accompanied by a revival of organ music, which was continued by  , later   and  .\n A specific national romanticism had by now emerged in almost all European countries. The national Russian current started by Glinka was continued in Russia by the \" \":  ,  ,  ,  , and  . More western oriented were   and  , whose   and symphonies gained great popularity.\n  founded   national music with his operas and the Symphony poems oriented towards Liszt. The symphonies, concerts and chamber music works of  , on the other hand, have Brahms as a model. In Poland,   was the leading opera composer, in Hungary  . Norway produced its best-known composers with  , creator of lyrical piano works, songs and orchestral works such as the Peer-Gynt Suite; England's voice resonated with the Brahms-oriented   and symphonist, as well as the bizarre  operettas of  .\n In late Romanticism, also called post-Romanticism, the traditional forms and elements of music are further dissolved. An increasingly colorful orchestral palette, an ever-increasing range of musical means, the spread of   to its limits, exaggerated emotions and an increasingly individual tonal language of the individual composer are typical features; the music is led to the threshold of  .\nThus, the symphonies of   reached previously unknown dimensions, partly give up the traditional four-sentence and often contain vocal proportions. But behind the monumental facade is the modern expressiveness of the  . This psychological expressiveness is also contained in the songs of  , miniature dramas for voice and piano. More committed to tradition, particularly oriented towards Bruckner, are the symphonies of   and  , while   resorted to Bach's polyphony in his numerous instrumental works, but developed it harmoniously extremely boldly.

Classical music has a lighter, clearer texture than Baroque music, but a more varying use of  , which is, in simpler terms, the rhythm and organization of any given piece of music. It is mainly  , using a clear   line over a subordinate chordal  ,  but   was by no means forgotten, especially in   vocal music and, later in the period, secular instrumental music. It also makes use of   which emphasized light elegance in place of the Baroque's dignified seriousness and impressive grandeur. Variety and contrast within a piece became more pronounced than before and the   increased in size, range, and power.\n The   was replaced as the main keyboard instrument by the   (or  ). Unlike the harpsichord, which plucks strings with quills, pianos strike the strings with leather-covered hammers when the keys are pressed, which enables the performer to play louder or softer (hence the original name \"fortepiano,\" literally \"loud soft\") and play with more expression; in contrast, the force with which a performer plays the harpsichord keys does not change the sound. Instrumental music was considered important by Classical period composers. The main kinds of instrumental music were the  ,  ,  ,  ,   (performed by an orchestra) and the solo  , which featured a virtuoso solo performer playing a solo work for violin, piano, flute, or another instrument, accompanied by an orchestra. Vocal music, such as   (notably the work of Schubert),  , and   (a staged dramatic work for singers and orchestra) were also important during this period.\n The best-known composers from this period are  ,  ,  , and  ; other names in this period include:  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,   and the  . Beethoven is regarded either as a Romantic composer or a Classical period composer who was part of the transition to the Romantic era. Schubert is also a transitional figure, as were  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,   and  . The period is sometimes referred to as the era of   (German:  ), since Gluck, Haydn, Salieri, Mozart, Beethoven, and Schubert all worked in  .\n In the middle of the 18th century, Europe began to move toward a new style in  , literature, and the arts, generally known as  . This style sought to emulate the ideals of  , especially those of  .  Classical music used formality and emphasis on order and hierarchy, and a \"clearer\", \"cleaner\" style that used clearer divisions between parts (notably a clear, single melody accompanied by chords), brighter contrasts and \"tone colors\" (achieved by the use of dynamic changes and   to more keys). In contrast with the richly layered music of the Baroque era, Classical music moved towards simplicity rather than complexity. In addition, the typical size of orchestras began to increase,  giving orchestras a more powerful sound.\n The remarkable development of ideas in \" \" had already established itself in the public consciousness. In particular,     was taken as a paradigm: structures should be well-founded in   and be both well-articulated and orderly. This taste for structural clarity began to affect music, which moved away from the layered   of the Baroque period toward a style known as  , in which the   is played over a subordinate  .  This move meant that   became a much more prevalent feature of music, even if they interrupted the melodic smoothness of a single part. As a result, the   structure of a piece of music became  .\n The new style was also encouraged by changes in the economic order and social structure. As the 18th century progressed well, the nobility became the primary patrons of instrumental music, while public taste increasingly preferred lighter, funny  . This led to changes in the way music was performed, the most crucial of which was the move to standard instrumental groups and the reduction in the importance of the  —the rhythmic and harmonic groundwork of a piece of music, typically played by a keyboard (  or  ) and usually accompanied by a varied group of bass instruments, including  ,  ,  , and  . One way to trace the decline of the continuo and its   chords is to examine the disappearance of the term  , meaning a mandatory instrumental part in a work of  . In Baroque compositions, additional instruments could be added to the continuo group according to the group or leader's preference; in Classical compositions, all parts were specifically noted, though not always  , so the term \"obbligato\" became redundant. By 1800, basso continuo was practically extinct, except for the occasional use of a   continuo part in a religious   in the early 1800s.\n Economic changes also had the effect of altering the balance of availability and quality of musicians. While in the late Baroque, a major composer would have the entire musical resources of a town to draw on, the musical forces available at an aristocratic hunting lodge or small court were smaller and more fixed in their level of ability. This was a spur to having simpler parts for ensemble musicians to play, and in the case of a resident virtuoso group, a spur to writing spectacular, idiomatic parts for certain instruments, as in the case of the  , or virtuoso solo parts for particularly skilled violinists or flutists. In addition, the appetite by audiences for a continual supply of new music carried over from the Baroque. This meant that works had to be performable with, at best, one or two rehearsals. Even after 1790 Mozart writes about \"the rehearsal\", with the implication that his concerts would have only one rehearsal.\n Since there was a greater emphasis on a single melodic line, there was greater emphasis on notating that line for   and phrasing. This contrasts with the Baroque era, when melodies were typically written with no dynamics, phrasing marks or ornaments, as it was assumed that the performer would improvise these elements on the spot. In the Classical era, it became more common for composers to indicate where they wanted performers to play ornaments such as trills or turns. The simplification of texture made such instrumental detail more important, and also made the use of characteristic rhythms, such as attention-getting opening fanfares, the funeral march rhythm, or the minuet genre, more important in establishing and unifying the tone of a single movement.\n The Classical period also saw the gradual development of  , a set of structural principles for music that reconciled the Classical preference for melodic material with harmonic development, which could be applied across musical genres. The   itself continued to be the principal form for solo and chamber music, while later in the Classical period the   became a prominent genre. The   form for orchestra was created in this period (this is popularly attributed to  ). The   (a concerto for more than one musician), a very popular form in the Baroque era, began to be replaced by the  , featuring only one soloist. Composers began to place more importance on the particular soloist's ability to show off virtuoso skills, with challenging, fast scale and arpeggio runs. Nonetheless, some   remained, the most famous of which being Mozart's  .\n In the classical period, the   consists of   with contrasting melodic figures and  . These phrases are relatively brief, typically four bars in length, and can occasionally seem sparse or terse. The texture is mainly  ,  with a clear melody above a subordinate chordal  , for instance an  . This contrasts with the practice in  , where a piece or movement would typically have only one musical subject, which would then be worked out in a number of voices according to the principles of  , while maintaining a consistent rhythm or metre throughout. As a result, Classical music tends to have a lighter, clearer texture than the Baroque. The classical style draws on the  , a musical style which emphasized light elegance in place of the Baroque's dignified seriousness and impressive grandeur.\n Structurally, Classical music generally has a clear  , with a well-defined contrast between   and  , introduced by clear  .   are used to highlight the structural characteristics of the piece. In particular,   and its variants were developed during the early classical period and was frequently used. The Classical approach to structure again contrasts with the Baroque, where a composition would normally move between tonic and dominant and back again , but through a continual progress of chord changes and without a sense of \"arrival\" at the new key. While counterpoint was less emphasised in the classical period, it was by no means forgotten, especially later in the period, and composers still used counterpoint in \"serious\" works such as symphonies and string quartets, as well as religious pieces, such as Masses.\n The classical musical style was supported by technical developments in instruments. The widespread adoption of   made classical musical structure possible, by ensuring that cadences in all keys sounded similar. The   and then the   replaced the  , enabling more dynamic contrast and more sustained melodies. Over the Classical period, keyboard instruments became richer, more sonorous and more powerful.\n The orchestra increased in size and range, and became more standardised. The   or     role in orchestra fell out of use between 1750 and 1775, leaving the string section.   became a self-contained section, consisting of  ,  ,   and  .\n While vocal music such as   was popular, great importance was given to instrumental music. The main kinds of instrumental music were the  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,   (usually for a virtuoso solo instrument accompanied by orchestra), and light pieces such as   and  .   developed and became the most important form. It was used to build up the first movement of most large-scale works in   and  . Sonata form was also used in other movements and in single, standalone pieces such as  .\n In his book  , author and pianist   claims that from 1755 to 1775, composers groped for a new style that was more effectively dramatic. In the High Baroque period, dramatic expression was limited to the representation of individual   (the \"doctrine of affections\", or what Rosen terms \"dramatic sentiment\"). For example, in Handel's oratorio  , the composer renders four emotions separately, one for each character, in the quartet \"O, spare your daughter\". Eventually this depiction of individual emotions came to be seen as simplistic and unrealistic; composers sought to portray multiple emotions, simultaneously or progressively, within a single character or movement (\"dramatic action\"). Thus in the finale of act 2 of Mozart's  , the lovers move \"from joy through suspicion and outrage to final reconciliation.\" \n Musically speaking, this \"dramatic action\" required more musical variety. Whereas Baroque music was characterized by seamless flow within individual movements and largely uniform textures, composers after the High Baroque sought to interrupt this flow with abrupt changes in texture, dynamic, harmony, or tempo. Among the stylistic developments which followed the High Baroque, the most dramatic came to be called  , (roughly \" \"), and its best-known practitioner was  . Composers of this style employed the above-discussed interruptions in the most abrupt manner, and the music can sound illogical at times. The Italian composer   took these developments further. His more than five hundred single-movement keyboard sonatas also contain abrupt changes of texture, but these changes are organized into periods, balanced phrases that became a hallmark of the classical style. However, Scarlatti's changes in texture still sound sudden and unprepared. The outstanding achievement of the great classical composers (Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven) was their ability to make these dramatic surprises sound logically motivated, so that \"the expressive and the elegant could join hands.\" \n Between the death of J. S. Bach and the maturity of Haydn and Mozart (roughly 1750–1770), composers experimented with these new ideas, which can be seen in the music of Bach's sons. Johann Christian developed a style which we now call  , comprising simpler textures and harmonies, and which was \"charming, undramatic, and a little empty.\" As mentioned previously, Carl Philipp Emmanuel sought to increase drama, and his music was \"violent, expressive, brilliant, continuously surprising, and often incoherent.\" And finally Wilhelm Friedemann, J.S. Bach's eldest son, extended Baroque traditions in an idiomatic, unconventional way. \n At first the new style took over Baroque forms—the ternary  , the   and the  —but composed with simpler parts, more notated ornamentation, rather than the improvised ornaments that were common in the Baroque era, and more emphatic division of pieces into sections. However, over time, the new aesthetic caused radical changes in how pieces were put together, and the basic formal layouts changed. Composers from this period sought dramatic effects, striking melodies, and clearer textures. One of the big textural changes was a shift away from the complex, dense   style of the Baroque, in which multiple interweaving melodic lines were played simultaneously, and towards  , a lighter texture which uses a clear single melody line accompanied by chords.\n Baroque music generally uses many harmonic fantasies and polyphonic sections that focus less on the structure of the musical piece, and there was less emphasis on clear musical phrases. In the classical period, the harmonies became simpler. However, the structure of the piece, the phrases and small melodic or rhythmic motives, became much more important than in the Baroque period.\n Another important break with the past was the radical overhaul of   by  , who cut away a great deal of the layering and improvisational ornaments and focused on the points of   and transition. By making these moments where the harmony changes more of a focus, he enabled powerful dramatic shifts in the emotional color of the music. To highlight these transitions, he used changes in instrumentation ( ), melody, and  . Among the most successful composers of his time, Gluck spawned many emulators, including  . Their emphasis on accessibility brought huge successes in opera, and in other vocal music such as songs, oratorios, and choruses. These were considered the most important kinds of music for performance and hence enjoyed greatest public success.\n The phase between the Baroque and the rise of the Classical (around 1730), was home to various competing musical styles. The diversity of artistic paths are represented in the sons of  :  , who continued the Baroque tradition in a personal way;  , who simplified textures of the Baroque and most clearly influenced Mozart; and  , who composed passionate and sometimes violently eccentric music of the   movement. Musical culture was caught at a crossroads: the masters of the older style had the technique, but the public hungered for the new. This is one of the reasons C. P. E. Bach was held in such high regard: he understood the older forms quite well and knew how to present them in new garb, with an enhanced variety of form.\n By the late 1750s there were flourishing centers of the new style in Italy, Vienna, Mannheim, and Paris; dozens of symphonies were composed and there were bands of players associated with musical theatres. Opera or other vocal music accompanied by orchestra was the feature of most musical events, with concertos and symphonies (arising from the  ) serving as instrumental interludes and introductions for operas and church services. Over the course of the Classical period, symphonies and concertos developed and were presented independently of vocal music.\n The \"normal\" orchestra ensemble—a body of   supplemented by winds—and movements of particular rhythmic character were established by the late 1750s in Vienna. However, the length and weight of pieces was still set with some Baroque characteristics: individual movements still focused on one \"affect\" (musical mood) or had only one sharply contrasting middle section, and their length was not significantly greater than Baroque movements. There was not yet a clearly enunciated theory of how to compose in the new style. It was a moment ripe for a breakthrough.\n The first great master of the style was the composer  . In the late 1750s he began composing symphonies, and by 1761 he had composed a triptych ( ,  , and  ) solidly in the contemporary mode. As a vice-  and later Kapellmeister, his output expanded: he composed over forty symphonies in the 1760s alone. And while his fame grew, as his orchestra was expanded and his compositions were copied and disseminated, his voice was only one among many.\n While some scholars suggest that Haydn was later overshadowed by Mozart and Beethoven, it would be difficult to overstate Haydn's centrality to the new style, and therefore to the future of Western art music as a whole. At the time, before the pre-eminence of Mozart or Beethoven, and with Johann Sebastian Bach known primarily to connoisseurs of keyboard music, Haydn reached a place in music that set him above all other composers except perhaps the Baroque era's  . Haydn took existing ideas, and radically altered how they functioned—earning him the titles \"father of the  \" and \"father of the  \".\n One of the forces that worked as an impetus for his pressing forward was the first stirring of what would later be called  —the  , or \"storm and stress\" phase in the arts, a short period where obvious and dramatic emotionalism was a stylistic preference. Haydn accordingly wanted more dramatic contrast and more emotionally appealing melodies, with sharpened character and individuality in his pieces. This period faded away in music and literature: however, it influenced what came afterward and would eventually be a component of aesthetic taste in later decades.\n The  , No. 45 in F  minor, exemplifies Haydn's integration of the differing demands of the new style, with surprising sharp turns and a long slow adagio to end the work. In 1772, Haydn completed his Opus 20 set of six string quartets, in which he deployed the polyphonic techniques he had gathered from the previous Baroque era to provide structural coherence capable of holding together his melodic ideas. For some, this marks the beginning of the \"mature\" Classical style, a transitional period in which reaction against late Baroque complexity yielded to integration of Baroque and Classical elements.\n Haydn, having worked for over a decade as the music director for a prince, had far more resources and scope for composing than most other composers. His position also gave him the ability to shape the forces that would play his music, as he could select skilled musicians. This opportunity was not wasted, as Haydn, beginning quite early on his career, sought to press forward the technique of building and developing ideas in his music. His next important breakthrough was in the   (1781), in which the melodic and the harmonic roles segue among the instruments: it is often momentarily unclear what is melody and what is harmony. This changes the way the ensemble works its way between dramatic moments of transition and climactic sections: the music flows smoothly and without obvious interruption. He then took this integrated style and began applying it to orchestral and vocal music.\n Haydn's gift to music was a way of composing, a way of structuring works, which was at the same time in accord with the governing aesthetic of the new style. However, a younger contemporary,  , brought his genius to Haydn's ideas and applied them to two of the major genres of the day: opera, and the virtuoso concerto. Whereas Haydn spent much of his working life as a court composer, Mozart wanted public success in the concert life of cities, playing for the general public. This meant he needed to write operas and write and perform virtuoso pieces. Haydn was not a virtuoso at the international touring level; nor was he seeking to create operatic works that could play for many nights in front of a large audience. Mozart wanted to achieve both. Moreover, Mozart also had a taste for more chromatic chords (and greater contrasts in harmonic language generally), a greater love for creating a welter of melodies in a single work, and a more Italianate sensibility in music as a whole. He found, in Haydn's music and later in his study of the polyphony of  , the means to discipline and enrich his artistic gifts.\n Mozart rapidly came to the attention of Haydn, who hailed the new composer, studied his works, and considered the younger man his only true peer in music. In Mozart, Haydn found a greater range of instrumentation, dramatic effect and melodic resource. The learning relationship moved in both directions. Mozart also had a great respect for the older, more experienced composer, and sought to learn from him.\n Mozart's arrival in Vienna in 1780 brought an acceleration in the development of the Classical style. There, Mozart absorbed the fusion of Italianate brilliance and Germanic cohesiveness that had been brewing for the previous 20 years. His own taste for flashy brilliances, rhythmically complex melodies and figures, long   melodies, and virtuoso flourishes was merged with an appreciation for formal coherence and internal connectedness. It is at this point that war and economic inflation halted a trend to larger orchestras and forced the disbanding or reduction of many theater orchestras. This pressed the Classical style inwards: toward seeking greater ensemble and technical challenges—for example, scattering the melody across woodwinds, or using a melody harmonized in thirds. This process placed a premium on small ensemble music, called chamber music. It also led to a trend for more public performance, giving a further boost to the string quartet and other small ensemble groupings.\n It was during this decade that public taste began, increasingly, to recognize that Haydn and Mozart had reached a high standard of composition. By the time Mozart arrived at age 25, in 1781, the dominant styles of Vienna were recognizably connected to the emergence in the 1750s of the early Classical style. By the end of the 1780s, changes in  , the relative standing of instrumental and vocal music, technical demands on musicians, and stylistic unity had become established in the composers who imitated Mozart and Haydn. During this decade Mozart composed his most famous operas, his six late symphonies that helped to redefine the genre, and a string of piano concerti that still stand at the pinnacle of these forms.\n One composer who was influential in spreading the more serious style that Mozart and Haydn had formed is  , a gifted virtuoso pianist who tied with Mozart in a musical \"duel\" before the emperor in which they each improvised on the piano and performed their compositions. Clementi's sonatas for the piano circulated widely, and he became the most successful composer in   during the 1780s. Also in London at this time was  , who, like Clementi, encouraged piano makers to extend the range and other features of their instruments, and then fully exploited the newly opened up possibilities. The importance of London in the Classical period is often overlooked, but it served as the home to the   factory for piano manufacturing and as the base for composers who, while less notable than the \"Vienna School\", had a decisive influence on what came later. They were composers of many fine works, notable in their own right. London's taste for virtuosity may well have encouraged the complex passage work and extended statements on tonic and dominant.\n When Haydn and Mozart began composing, symphonies were played as single movements—before, between, or as interludes within other works—and many of them lasted only ten or twelve minutes; instrumental groups had varying standards of playing, and the continuo was a central part of music-making.\n In the intervening years, the social world of music had seen dramatic changes. International publication and touring had grown explosively, and concert societies formed. Notation became more specific, more descriptive—and schematics for works had been simplified (yet became more varied in their exact working out). In 1790, just before Mozart's death, with his reputation spreading rapidly, Haydn was poised for a series of successes, notably his late oratorios and  . Composers in Paris, Rome, and all over Germany turned to Haydn and Mozart for their ideas on form.\n In the 1790s, a new generation of composers, born around 1770, emerged. While they had grown up with the earlier styles, they heard in the recent works of Haydn and Mozart a vehicle for greater expression. In 1788   settled in Paris and in 1791 composed  , an opera that raised him to fame. Its style is clearly reflective of the mature Haydn and Mozart, and its instrumentation gave it a weight that had not yet been felt in the  . His contemporary   extended instrumental effects with his 1790 opera  , from which followed a series of successes. The final push towards change came from  , who was deeply admired by future romantic composers such as Weber, Berlioz and Wagner. The innovative harmonic language of his operas, their refined instrumentation and their \"enchained\" closed numbers (a structural pattern which was later adopted by Weber in Euryanthe and from him handed down, through Marschner, to Wagner), formed the basis from which French and German romantic opera had its beginnings.\n The most fateful of the new generation was  , who launched his numbered works in 1794 with a set of three piano trios, which remain in the repertoire. Somewhat younger than the others, though equally accomplished because of his youthful study under Mozart and his native virtuosity, was  . Hummel studied under Haydn as well; he was a friend to Beethoven and  . He concentrated more on the piano than any other instrument, and his time in London in 1791 and 1792 generated the composition and publication in 1793 of three piano sonatas, opus 2, which idiomatically used Mozart's techniques of avoiding the expected cadence, and Clementi's sometimes modally uncertain virtuoso figuration. Taken together, these composers can be seen as the vanguard of a broad change in style and the center of music. They studied one another's works, copied one another's gestures in music, and on occasion behaved like quarrelsome rivals.\n The crucial differences with the previous wave can be seen in the downward shift in melodies, increasing durations of movements, the acceptance of Mozart and Haydn as paradigmatic, the greater use of keyboard resources, the shift from \"vocal\" writing to \"pianistic\" writing, the growing pull of the minor and of modal ambiguity, and the increasing importance of varying accompanying figures to bring \"texture\" forward as an element in music. In short, the late Classical was seeking music that was internally more complex. The growth of concert societies and amateur orchestras, marking the importance of music as part of middle-class life, contributed to a booming market for pianos, piano music, and virtuosi to serve as exemplars. Hummel, Beethoven, and Clementi were all renowned for their improvising.\n The direct influence of the Baroque continued to fade: the   grew less prominent as a means of holding performance together, the performance practices of the mid-18th century continued to die out. However, at the same time, complete editions of Baroque masters began to become available, and the influence of Baroque style continued to grow, particularly in the ever more expansive use of brass. Another feature of the period is the growing number of performances where the composer was not present. This led to increased detail and specificity in notation; for example, there were fewer \"optional\" parts that stood separately from the main score.\n The force of these shifts became apparent with Beethoven's 3rd Symphony, given the name  , which is Italian for \"heroic\", by the composer. As with Stravinsky's  , it may not have been the first in all of its innovations, but its aggressive use of every part of the Classical style set it apart from its contemporary works: in length, ambition, and harmonic resources as well making it the first symphony of the  .\n The   is a name mostly used to refer to three composers of the Classical period in late-18th-century  : Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven.   is occasionally added to the list.\n In German-speaking countries, the term   (lit.  ) is used. That term is often more broadly applied to the Classical era in music as a whole, as a means to distinguish it from other periods that are colloquially referred to as  , namely   and  .\n The term \"Viennese School\" was first used by Austrian musicologist Raphael Georg Kiesewetter in 1834, although he only counted Haydn and Mozart as members of the school. Other writers followed suit, and eventually Beethoven was added to the list.  The designation \"first\" is added today to avoid confusion with the  .\n Whilst, Schubert apart, these composers certainly knew each other (with Haydn and Mozart even being occasional chamber-music partners), there is no sense in which they were engaged in a collaborative effort in the sense that one would associate with 20th-century schools such as the Second Viennese School, or  . Nor is there any significant sense in which one composer was \"schooled\" by another (in the way that Berg and Webern were taught by Schoenberg), though it is true that Beethoven for a time received lessons from Haydn.\n Attempts to extend the First Viennese School to include such later figures as  ,  , and   are merely journalistic, and never encountered in academic musicology. According to scholar James F. Daugherty, the Classical period itself from approximately 1775 to 1825 is sometimes referred to as \"the Viennese Classic period\". \n Musical eras and their prevalent styles, forms and instruments seldom disappear at once; instead, features are replaced over time, until the old approach is simply felt as \"old-fashioned\". The Classical style did not \"die\" suddenly; rather, it gradually got phased out under the weight of changes. To give just one example, while it is generally stated that the Classical era stopped using the   in orchestras, this did not happen all of a sudden at the start of the Classical era in 1750. Rather, orchestras slowly stopped using the harpsichord to play   until the practice was discontinued by the end of the 1700s.\n One crucial change was the shift towards harmonies centering on \"flatward\" keys: shifts in the   direction  . In the Classical style, major key was far more common than minor, chromaticism being moderated through the use of \"sharpward\" modulation (e.g., a piece in C major modulating to G major, D major, or A major, all of which are keys with more sharps). As well, sections in the minor mode were often used for contrast. Beginning with Mozart and Clementi, there began a creeping colonization of the subdominant region (the ii or IV chord, which in the key of C major would be the keys of d minor or F major). With Schubert, subdominant modulations flourished after being introduced in contexts in which earlier composers would have confined themselves to dominant shifts (modulations to the  , e.g., in the key of C major, modulating to G major). This introduced darker colors to music, strengthened the minor mode, and made structure harder to maintain. Beethoven contributed to this by his increasing use of the   as a  , and modal ambiguity—for example, the opening of the  .\n ,  ,  ,  , and   are among the most prominent in this generation of \"Proto-Romantics\", along with the young  . Their sense of form was strongly influenced by the Classical style. While they were not yet \"learned\" composers (imitating rules which were codified by others), they directly responded to works by Haydn, Mozart, Clementi, and others, as they encountered them. The instrumental forces at their disposal in orchestras were also quite \"Classical\" in number and variety, permitting similarity with Classical works.\n However, the forces destined to end the hold of the Classical style gathered strength in the works of many of the above composers, particularly Beethoven. The most commonly cited one is harmonic innovation. Also important is the increasing focus on having a continuous and rhythmically uniform accompanying figuration:   was the model for hundreds of later pieces—where the shifting movement of a rhythmic figure provides much of the drama and interest of the work, while a melody drifts above it. Greater knowledge of works, greater instrumental expertise, increasing variety of instruments, the growth of concert societies, and the unstoppable domination of the increasingly more powerful piano (which was given a bolder, louder tone by technological developments such as the use of steel strings, heavy cast-iron frames and sympathetically vibrating strings) all created a huge audience for sophisticated music. All of these trends contributed to the  .\n Drawing the line between these two styles is very difficult: some sections of Mozart's later works, taken alone, are indistinguishable in harmony and orchestration from music written 80 years later—and some composers continued to write in normative Classical styles into the early 20th century. Even before Beethoven's death, composers such as   were self-described Romantics, incorporating, for example, more extravagant   in their works (e.g., using chromatic harmonies in a piece's  ). Conversely, works such as  , written during the chronological end of the Classical era and dawn of the   era, exhibit a deliberately anachronistic artistic paradigm, harking back to the compositional style of several decades before.\n However, Vienna's fall as the most important musical center for orchestral composition during the late 1820s, precipitated by the deaths of   and  , marked the Classical style's final eclipse—and the end of its continuous organic development of one composer learning in close proximity to others.   and   visited Vienna when they were young, but they then moved on to other cities. Composers such as  , while deeply influenced by Beethoven, also searched for new ideas and new forms to contain the larger world of musical expression and performance in which they lived.\n Renewed interest in the formal balance and restraint of 18th century classical music led in the early 20th century to the development of so-called   style, which numbered   and   among its proponents, at least at certain times in their careers.\n The Baroque guitar, with four or five sets of double strings or \"courses\" and elaborately decorated soundhole, was a very different instrument from the early   which more closely resembles the modern instrument with the standard six strings. Judging by the number of instructional manuals published for the instrument – over three hundred texts were published by over two hundred authors between 1760 and 1860 – the classical period marked a golden age for guitar. \n In the Baroque era, there was more variety in the bowed stringed instruments used in ensembles, with instruments such as the   and a range of fretted   being used, ranging from small viols to large bass viols. In the Classical period, the   of the orchestra was standardized as just four instruments:\n In the Baroque era, the double bass players were not usually given a separate part; instead, they typically played the same     that the cellos and other low-pitched instruments (e.g.,  ,   wind instrument,  ), albeit an octave below the cellos, because the double bass is a transposing instrument that sounds one octave lower than it is written. In the Classical era, some composers continued to write only one bass part for their symphony, labeled \"bassi\"; this bass part was played by cellists and double bassists. During the Classical era, some composers began to give the double basses their own part.\n It was commonplace for all orchestras to have at least 2 winds, usually oboes, flutes, clarinets, or sometimes english horns (see  . Patrons also usually employed an ensemble of entirely winds, called the  , which would be employed for certain events. The   would sometimes join the larger string orchestra to serve as the wind section.\n"},

Sonata form was the foundation for a large number of pieces which provided a foundation for the new era of Romanticism. \n Characterized by lyrical melodies,   and  , and dramatic dynamics, the Romantic era evoked emotions assembled by sovereign story lines and nationalist marches reflecting change.  New musical vocabulary began to further develop using terms like \" \" or \"dolente\", in addition to enriched harmonic and rhythmic language.  Orchestral forms like symphonic poem, choral symphony, and works for solo voice and orchestra, began to draw other art forms closer. \n Romantic music was a self-conscious break from the ideals of the   as well as a reaction to socio-political desire for greater human freedom from despotism.  The movement sought to express the liberty, fraternity, and equality which writers such as   and   artistically defended by creating new lyric poetry.  There was a new surrender to nature, nostalgia for the past, a turn towards the mystical, new attention to national identity, interest in the autobiographical, and a general discontentment with musical formulas and conventions exercised in Classical compositions.  Conductors became the central figures in orchestral performances, responsible for the sonic flow of larger pieces. \n The   or \"storm and drive\" was a proto-Romantic movement that helped establish the aesthetics of the Romantic era.  It contrasted with the simple pieces of the Classical era into obvious and dramatic emotionalism sought by Romantic composers.  Composers such as   were fond of having compositional work reflect the turbulent political climate.  This led to the creation of the   No. 45 in F  Minor, containing several characteristics of this transition through long slow adagio and sharp turns to exemplify the demands of wavering opinions and philosophical themes taking place socially. \n The   facilitated a dramatic expansion in   size and greater diversity in instruments.  The main transition was promoted by improvements to the piano, with cast-iron frames enabling thicker strings and deeper brilliant tones.  Likewise, new instruments were created such as the  , and earlier instruments like the piccolo and English horn were improved, to contribute to the new dream-like interpretation of the past. New public   accommodated the growing size of orchestras.  It was during the main transitional period that a distinction between \"highbrow\" and \"lowbrow\" compositional works was established, with popular \"light music\" seen as entertainment and \"art music\" viewed as serious listening. \n It was not until the end of the nineteenth century that the emergent discipline of   ( ) began to identify which composers contributed to the transition between the Classical and Romantic eras.    , better known for composing classical music, incorporated opera, concerto, symphony, sonata, and string quartets which introduced Romantic qualities to music of the time. \n The concept of programmatic music was prevalent among transitional pieces such as Ludwig van Beethoven's titles of  ,   and  .  Giving compositions characteristic names was expanded upon by Romantic composers such as   and became standard. \n Franz Schubert took part in the Classical to Romantic transition by being considered the last of the classical composers in his earlier instrumental pieces, and the first of the romantics through his 600 art songs that were melodic and harmonic. \n After the transitional period, the virtuoso piano styles of the Romantics   and   were important to consolidating the Romantic movement.\n"},

After World War II, for the first time audience members valued older music over   works, a preference which has been catered to by the emergence and widespread availability of commercial recordings.  Trends of the mid-20th century to the present day include  ,  ,  ,  , and more recently   and  . Increasingly global, practitioners from the Americas, Africa and Asia have obtained crucial roles,  while symphony orchestras and   now appear across the world.\n Both the English term \"classical\" and the German equivalent   developed from the French  , itself derived from the Latin word  , which originally referred to the highest   of  .  In Roman usage, the term later became a means to distinguish revered literary figures;  the Roman author   commended writers such as   and   as  .

The musicologist   summarizes this into two definitions: 1) a \"formal discipline\" and 2) a \"model of excellence\".  Like Gellius, later Renaissance scholars who wrote in Latin used   in reference to writers of  ;  however, this meaning only gradually developed, and was for a while subordinate to the broader classical ideals of formality and excellence.  Literature and visual arts—for which substantial Ancient Greek and Roman examples existed—did eventually adopt the term \"classical\" as relating to classical antiquity, but virtually no music of that time was available to Renaissance musicians, limiting the connection between classical music and the  . \n It was in 18th-century England that the term 'classical' \"first came to stand for a particular canon of works in performance.\"    had developed a prominent public concert music scene, unprecedented and unmatched by other European cities.  The royal court had gradually lost its monopoly on music, in large part from instability that the  's dissolution and the   enacted on court musicians.  In 1672, the former court musician   began giving popular public concerts at a London tavern;  his popularity rapidly inaugurated the prominence of public concerts in the London.  The conception of \"classical\"—or more often \"ancient music\"—emerged, which was still built on the principles of formality and excellence, and according to Heartz \"civic ritual, religion and moral activism figured significantly in this novel construction of musical taste\".  The performance of such music was specialized by the   and later at the   series, where the work of select 16th and 17th composers was featured,  especially  .  In France, the reign of   ( ) saw a cultural renaissance, by the end of which writers such as  ,   and   were considered to have surpassed the achievements of classical antiquity.  They were thus characterized as \"classical\", as was the music of   (and later  ), being designated as \"l'opéra française classique\".  In the rest of  , the abandonment of defining \"classical\" as analogous to the Greco-Roman World was slower, primarily because the formation of canonical repertoires was either minimal or exclusive to the upper classes. \n Many European commentators of the early 19th century found new unification in their definition of classical music: to juxtapose the older composers  ,  , and (excluding some of his  )   as \"classical\" against the emerging style of  .  These three composers in particular were grouped into the  , sometimes called the \"Viennese classics\",  a coupling that remains problematic by reason of none of the three being born in Vienna and the minimal time Haydn and Mozart spent in the city.  While this was an often expressed characterization, it was not a strict one. In 1879 the composer   defined the following composers as classical:  , Handel, Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven,  ,   and  .  More broadly, some writers used the term \"classical\" to generally praise well-regarded outputs from various composers, particularly those who produced many works in an established genre. \n The contemporary understanding of the term \"classical music\" remains vague and multifaceted.  Other terms such as \"art music\", \"canonic music\", \"cultivated music\" and \"serious music\" are largely synonymous.  The term \"classical music\" is often indicated or implied to concern solely the  ,  and conversely, in many academic histories the term \"Western music\" excludes non-classical Western music.  Another complication lies in that \"classical music\" is sometimes used to describe non-Western art music exhibiting similar long-lasting and complex characteristics; examples include   (i.e.       and  ),   music, and various styles of the court of Imperial China (see   for instance).  Thus in the later 20th century terms such as \"Western classical music\" and \"Western art music\" came in use to address this.  The musicologist   notes that neither term is ideal, as they create an \"intriguing complication\" when considering \"certain practitioners of Western-art music genres who come from non-Western cultures\". \n Complexity in   and   are typical traits of classical music.  The   ( ) offers three definitions for the word \"classical\" in relation to music: \n The last definition concerns what is now termed the  , a specific stylistic era of European music from the second half of the 18th century to the beginning of the 19th century. \n The Western classical tradition formally begins with music created by and for the early Christian Church.  It is probable that the early Church wished to disassociate itself from the predominant   and  , as it was a reminder of the   it had   and  .  As such, it remains unclear as to what extent the music of the Christian Church, and thus Western classical music as a whole, was influenced by preceding  .  The general attitude towards music was adopted from the   and   music theorists and commentators.  Just as in Greco-Roman society, music was considered central to education; along with arithmetic, geometry and astronomy, music was included in the   the four subjects of the upper division of a standard   in the  .  This high regard for music was first promoted by the scholars  ,  ,  and particularly  ,  whose transmission and expansion on the perspectives of music from  ,   and   were crucial in the development of medieval musical thought.  However, scholars,   and   regularly misinterpreted or misunderstood the writings of their Greek and Roman predecessors.  This was due to the complete absence of surviving Greco-Roman musical works available to medieval musicians,  to the extent that Isidore of Seville ( ) stated \"unless sounds are remembered by man, they perish, for they cannot be written down\", unaware of the   of Ancient Greece centuries before.  The musicologist   notes, however, that many Greco-Roman texts can still be credited as influential to Western classical music, since medieval musicians regularly read their works—regardless of whether they were doing so correctly. \n However, there are some indisputable musical continuations from the  .  Basic aspects such as  ,   and the dominance of text in musical settings are prominent in both early medieval and music of nearly all ancient civilizations.  Greek influences in particular include the   (which were descendants of developments by   and Pythagoras),  basic   from  ,  as well as the central function of  .  Ancient Greek instruments such as the   (a  ) and the   (a stringed instrument similar to a small  ) eventually led to several modern-day instruments of a symphonic orchestra.  However,   notes that attempting to create a direct evolutionary connection from the ancient music to early medieval is baseless, as it was almost solely influenced by Greco-Roman music theory, not performance or practice. \n Medieval music includes Western European music from after the   by 476 to about 1400.   chant, also called plainsong or  , was the dominant form until about 1100.  Christian monks developed the first forms of European musical notation in order to standardize liturgy throughout the Church.    (multi-voiced) music developed from monophonic chant throughout the late   and into the  , including the more complex voicings of  . During the  , the vocal music from the   genre, predominantly  , was  , using a single, unaccompanied vocal melody line.    vocal genres, which used multiple independent vocal melodies, began to develop during the  , becoming prevalent by the later 13th and early 14th century. Notable Medieval composers include  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  , and  .\n Many   still exist, but in different forms. Medieval instruments included the  , the   and plucked   like the  . As well, early versions of the   and   (or  ) existed. Medieval instruments in Europe had most commonly been used singly, often self accompanied with a   note, or occasionally in parts. From at least as early as the 13th century through the 15th century there was a division of instruments into   (loud, shrill, outdoor instruments) and   (quieter, more intimate instruments).  \n The musical Renaissance era lasted from 1400 to 1600. It was characterized by greater use of  , multiple interweaving melodic lines, and the use of earlier forms of  . Social dancing became more widespread, so musical forms appropriate to accompanying dance began to standardize. It is in this time that the notation of music on a   and other elements of   began to take shape.  This invention made possible the separation of the   of a piece of music from its  ; without written music, transmission was oral, and subject to change every time it was transmitted. With a  , a work of music could be performed without the composer's presence.  The invention of the movable-type   in the 15th century had far-reaching consequences on the preservation and transmission of music. \n Many instruments originated during the Renaissance; others were variations of, or improvements upon, instruments that had existed previously. Some have survived to the present day; others have disappeared, only to be re-created in order to perform music on period instruments. As in the modern day, instruments may be classified as brass, strings, percussion, and woodwind. Brass instruments in the Renaissance were traditionally played by professionals who were members of   and they included the  , the wooden  , the valveless   and the  . Stringed instruments included the  , the  , the harp-like  , the  , the  , the  , the  , the  , and the  .   instruments with strings included the   and the  . Percussion instruments include the  , the  , the  , the bells, the rumble-pot, and various kinds of drums. Woodwind instruments included the double-reed   (an early member of the   family), the  , the  , the  , the  , the  , and the  . Simple   existed, but were largely confined to churches, although there were portable varieties.  Printing enabled the standardization of descriptions and specifications of instruments, as well as instruction in their use. \n Vocal music in the Renaissance is noted for the flourishing of an increasingly elaborate   style. The principal liturgical forms which endured throughout the entire Renaissance period were masses and motets, with some other developments towards the end, especially as composers of sacred music began to adopt secular forms (such as the  ) for their own designs. Towards the end of the period, the early dramatic precursors of opera such as monody, the  , and the   are seen. Around 1597, Italian composer   wrote  , the first work to be called an   today. He also composed  , the first opera to have survived to the present day.\n Notable Renaissance composers include  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  , and  .\n The   is typically defined as the era between the formation and the dissolution of common-practice  .  The term usually spans roughly two-and-a-half centuries, encompassing the Baroque, Classical, and Romantic periods.\n Baroque music is characterized by the use of complex tonal   and the use of a  , a continuous bass line. Music became more complex in comparison with the simple songs of all previous periods.  The beginnings of the   took shape in the  , as did a more formalized notion of  . The tonalities of   as means for managing dissonance and   in music took full shape. \n During the Baroque era, keyboard music played on the   and   became increasingly popular, and the violin family of stringed instruments took the form generally seen today. Opera as a staged musical drama began to differentiate itself from earlier musical and dramatic forms, and vocal forms like the   and   became more common.  For the first time, vocalists began adding ornamentals to the music. \n The theories surrounding   began to be put in wider practice, as it enabled a wider range of chromatic possibilities in hard-to-tune keyboard instruments. Although   did not use equal temperament, changes in the temperaments from the then-common   to various temperaments that made modulation between all keys musically acceptable made possible his  . \n Baroque instruments included some instruments from the earlier periods (e.g., the hurdy-gurdy and recorder) and a number of new instruments (e.g., the oboe, bassoon, cello, contrabass and fortepiano). Some instruments from previous eras fell into disuse, such as the shawm,  ,  , and the wooden cornet. The key Baroque instruments for strings included the  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,   (which often played the   parts),  ,  ,   and hurdy-gurdy. Woodwinds included the  ,  ,   and the  . Brass instruments included the  ,  ,  ,   and the  . Keyboard instruments included the  , the  , the  , the  , and, later in the period, the   (an early version of the piano). Percussion instruments included the  ,  ,   and the  .\n One major difference between Baroque music and the classical era that followed it is that the types of instruments used in Baroque ensembles were much less standardized. A Baroque ensemble could include one of several different types of keyboard instruments (e.g., pipe organ or harpsichord),  additional stringed chordal instruments (e.g., a lute), bowed strings, woodwinds, and brass instruments, and an unspecified number of bass instruments performing the basso continuo,(e.g., a cello, contrabass, viola, bassoon, serpent, etc.).\n Vocal oeuvres of the Baroque era included suites such as   and  .  Secular music was less common, and was typically characterized only by instrumental music. Like  ,  themes were generally sacred and for the purpose of a catholic setting.\n Important composers of this era include  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  , and  .\n Though the term \"classical music\" includes all Western art music from the Medieval era to the early 2010s, the Classical Era was the period of Western art music from the 1750s to the early 1820s —the era of  ,  , and  .\n The Classical era established many of the norms of composition, presentation, and style, and when the piano became the predominant keyboard instrument. The   forces required for an   became somewhat standardized (though they would grow as the potential of a wider array of instruments was developed). Chamber music grew to include ensembles with as many as 8-10 performers for  .   continued to develop, with regional styles in Italy, France, and German-speaking lands. The  , a form of comic opera, rose in popularity. The   came into its own as a musical form, and the concerto was developed as a vehicle for displays of virtuoso playing skill. Orchestras no longer required a  , and were often led by the lead violinist (now called the  ). \n Classical era musicians continued to use many of the instruments from the Baroque era, such as the cello, contrabass, recorder, trombone, timpani, fortepiano (the precursor to the modern  ) and organ. While some Baroque instruments fell into disuse e.g. the theorbo and rackett, many Baroque instruments were changed into the versions still in use today, such as the Baroque violin (which became the  ), Baroque oboe (which became the  ) and Baroque trumpet, which transitioned to the regular valved trumpet. During the Classical era, the stringed instruments used in orchestra and   such as   were standardized as the four instruments which form the   of the orchestra: the violin, viola, cello, and double bass. Baroque-era stringed instruments such as fretted, bowed   were phased out. Woodwinds included the  ,  ,  , the Classical  , the  , the flute, oboe and bassoon. Keyboard instruments included the   and the  . While the   was still used in basso continuo accompaniment in the 1750s and 1760s, it fell out of use at the end of the century. Brass instruments included the  , the   (a replacement for the bass  , which was the precursor of the  ) and the  .\n Wind instruments became more refined in the Classical era. While   instruments like the oboe and   became somewhat standardized in the Baroque, the   family of   was not widely used until Mozart expanded its role in orchestral, chamber, and concerto settings. \n The music of the  , from roughly the first decade of the 19th century to the early 20th century, was characterized by increased attention to an extended melodic line, as well as expressive and emotional elements, paralleling   in other art forms. Musical forms began to break from the Classical era forms (even as those were being codified), with free-form pieces like  ,  , and   being written where accepted ideas about the exposition and development of themes were ignored or minimized.  The music became more chromatic, dissonant, and tonally colorful, with tensions (with respect to accepted norms of the older forms) about key signatures increasing.  The   (or  ) came to maturity in this era, as did the epic scales of  , ultimately transcended by  's  . \n In the 19th century, musical institutions emerged from the control of wealthy patrons, as composers and musicians could construct lives independent of the nobility. Increasing interest in music by the growing middle classes throughout western Europe spurred the creation of organizations for the teaching, performance, and preservation of music. The piano, which achieved its modern construction in this era (in part due to industrial advances in  ) became widely popular with the middle class, whose demands for the instrument spurred many piano builders. Many symphony orchestras date their founding to this era.  Some musicians and composers were the stars of the day; some, like   and  , fulfilled both roles. \n European cultural ideas and institutions began to follow colonial expansion into other parts of the world. There was also a rise, especially toward the end of the era, of   (echoing, in some cases, political sentiments of the time), as composers such as  ,  , and   echoed traditional music of their homelands in their compositions. \n In the Romantic era, the modern  , with a more powerful, sustained tone and a wider range took over from the more delicate-sounding fortepiano. In the orchestra, the existing Classical instruments and sections were retained ( , woodwinds, brass, and percussion), but these sections were typically expanded to make a fuller, bigger sound. For example, while a Baroque orchestra may have had two double bass players, a Romantic orchestra could have as many as ten. \"As music grew more expressive, the standard orchestral palette just wasn't rich enough for many Romantic composers.\" \n The families of instruments used, especially in orchestras, grew larger; a process that climaxed in the early 20th century with very large orchestras used by late romantic and modernist composers. A wider array of percussion instruments began to appear. Brass instruments took on larger roles, as the introduction of   made it possible for them to play a wider range of notes. The size of the orchestra (typically around 40 in the Classical era) grew to be over 100.   's 1906  , for example, has been performed with over 150 instrumentalists and choirs of over 400.  New woodwind instruments were added, such as the  ,   and   and new percussion instruments were added, including  ,  ,   (a bell-like keyboard instrument),  , and  ,  large  , and even   for  .   appear in some scores from the late 19th century onwards, usually featured as a solo instrument rather than as in integral part of the orchestra.\n The  , a modified member of the horn family, appears in  's cycle  . It also has a prominent role in  's   and is also used in several late romantic and modernist works by Richard Strauss,  , and others  Cornets appear regularly in 19th century scores, alongside trumpets which were regarded as less agile, at least until the end of the century.\n Prominent composers of this era include  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  , and  .   and   are commonly regarded as transitional composers whose music combines both late romantic and early modernist elements.\n Encompassing a wide variety of   styles, modernist classical music includes late romantic, impressionist, expressionist, and neoclassical styles of composition. Modernism marked an era when many composers rejected certain values of the common practice period, such as traditional tonality, melody, instrumentation, and structure. Some music historians regard musical modernism as an era extending from about 1890 to 1930.  Others consider that modernism ended with one or the other of the two world wars.  Still other authorities claim that modernism is not associated with any historical era, but rather is \"an   of the composer; a living construct that can evolve with the times\".  Despite its decline in the last third of the 20th century, there remained at the end of the century an active core of composers who continued to advance the ideas and forms of modernism, such as  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  , and  . \n Two musical movements that were dominant during this time were the   beginning around 1890 and the   that started around 1908. It was a period of diverse reactions in challenging and reinterpreting older categories of music, innovations that lead to new ways of organizing and approaching harmonic, melodic, sonic, and rhythmic aspects of music, and changes in aesthetic worldviews in close relation to the larger identifiable period of   in the arts of the time. The operative word most associated with it is \"innovation\".  Its leading feature is a \"linguistic plurality\", which is to say that no single   ever assumed a dominant position. \n The orchestra continued to grow during the early years modernist era, peaking in the first two decades of the 20th century. Saxophones that appeared only rarely during the 19th century became more commonly used as supplementary instruments, but never became core members of the orchestra. While appearing only as featured solo instruments in some works, for example  's orchestration of  's   and  's  , the saxophone is included in other works such as  's   and many other works as a member of the orchestral ensemble. In some compositions such as Ravel's  , two or more saxophones of different sizes are used to create an entire section like the other sections of the orchestra. The   is featured in a few late   and   works, usually playing parts marked \"tenor tuba\", including  's  , and  's  .\n Prominent composers of the early 20th century include  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  , and  , along with the aforementioned Mahler and Strauss as transitional figures who carried over from the 19th century.\n  is a period of music that began as early as 1930 according to some authorities.  It shares characteristics with   – that is, art that comes after and reacts against  .\n Some other authorities have more or less equated postmodern music with the \"contemporary music\" composed well after 1930, from the late 20th century through to the early 21st century.  Some of the diverse movements of the postmodern/contemporary era include the neoromantic, neomedieval, minimalist, and post minimalist.\n  at the beginning of the 21st century was often considered to include all post-1945 musical forms.  A generation later, this term now properly refers to the music of today written by composers who are still alive; music that came into prominence in the mid-1970s. It includes different variations of  ,  ,  , and  . \n  who have studied classical music extensively are said to be \"classically trained\". This training may come from private lessons from instrument or voice teachers or from completion of a formal program offered by a Conservatory, college or university, such as a   or   degree (which includes individual lessons from professors). In classical music, \"...extensive formal music education and training, often to postgraduate [Master's degree] level\" is required. \n Performance of classical music repertoire requires a proficiency in   and   playing,   principles, strong   (to correct and adjust pitches by ear), knowledge of   (e.g., Baroque ornamentation), and a familiarity with the style/musical idiom expected for a given composer or musical work (e.g., a Brahms symphony or a Mozart concerto). \n The key characteristic of European classical music that distinguishes it from  ,  , and some other classical music traditions such as  , is that the repertoire tends to be written down in  , creating a musical part or  . This score typically determines details of rhythm, pitch, and, where two or more musicians (whether singers or instrumentalists) are involved, how the various parts are coordinated. The written quality of the music has enabled a high level of complexity within them:  , for instance, achieve a remarkable marriage of boldly distinctive melodic lines weaving in   yet creating a coherent  . The use of written notation also preserves a record of the works and enables Classical musicians to perform music from many centuries ago.\n Although Classical music in the 2000s has lost most of its tradition for  , from the Baroque era to the Romantic era, there are examples of performers who could improvise in the style of their era. In the Baroque era, organ performers would improvise  , keyboard performers playing   would improvise   from the   symbols beneath the bass notes of the basso continuo part and both vocal and instrumental performers would improvise  .    was particularly noted for his complex improvisations.  During the Classical era, the composer-performer   was noted for his ability to improvise melodies in different styles.  During the Classical era, some virtuoso soloists would improvise the   sections of a concerto. During the Romantic era,   would improvise at the piano. \n Almost all of the composers who are described in music textbooks on classical music and whose works are widely performed as part of the   are male composers, even though there have been a   throughout the history of classical music. Musicologist   has asked \"[w]hy is   so marginal to the standard 'classical' repertoire?\"  Citron \"examines the practices and attitudes that have led to the exclusion of women composers from the received ' ' of performed musical works\". She argues that in the 1800s, women composers typically wrote   for performance in small recitals rather than   intended for performance with an orchestra in a large hall, with the latter works being seen as the most important genre for composers; since women composers did not write many symphonies, they were deemed not to be notable as composers.  In the \"... ,   is one of the only [ ] female composers mentioned.\"  Abbey Philips states that \"[d]uring the 20th century the women who were composing/playing gained far less attention than their male counterparts.\" \n Historically, major professional   have been mostly or entirely composed of musicians who are men. Some of the earliest cases of   was in the position of  . The  , for example, did not accept women to permanent membership until 1997, far later than the other orchestras ranked among the world's top five by   in 2008.  The last major orchestra to appoint a woman to a permanent position was the  .  As late as February 1996, the Vienna Philharmonic's principal flute,  , told   that accepting women would be \"gambling with the emotional unity ( ) that this organism currently has\".  In April 1996, the orchestra's press secretary wrote that \"compensating for the expected leaves of absence\" of   would be a problem. \n In 2013, an article in   stated that while \"[m]any prestigious orchestras have significant female membership—women outnumber men in the  's violin section—and several renowned ensembles, including the  , the  , and the Minnesota Orchestra, are led by women violinists\", the  , brass, and percussion sections of major orchestras \"...are still predominantly male\".  A 2014 BBC article stated that the \"...introduction of  , where a prospective instrumentalist performs behind a screen so that the judging panel can exercise no gender or racial prejudice, has seen the gender balance of traditionally male-dominated symphony orchestras gradually shift.\" \n Classical music has often incorporated elements or material from   of the composer's time. Examples include occasional music such as Brahms' use of student drinking songs in his  , genres exemplified by  's  , and the influence of   on early and mid-20th-century composers including  , exemplified by the movement entitled \"Blues\" in his sonata for violin and piano.  Some  ,   and   classical composers acknowledge a debt to popular music. \n 's 1924 orchestral composition   has been described as  . The composition combines elements of classical music with jazz-influenced effects.\n Numerous examples show influence in the opposite direction, including popular songs based on classical music, the use to which   has been put since the 1970s, and the musical   phenomenon, where classical musicians have achieved success in the popular music arena.  In  , a number of   (playing  ), including   and  ,  modeled their playing styles on Baroque or Classical-era instrumental music. \n Composers of classical music have often made use of   (music created by musicians who are commonly not classically trained, often from a purely oral tradition). Some composers, like   and  ,  have used folk themes to impart a nationalist flavor to their work, while others like   have used specific themes lifted whole from their folk-music origins.    widely incorporated into his work the folk music of his native  , but also other ethnic groups of the Middle East and Eastern Europe. \n Certain staples of classical music are often used commercially (either in advertising or in movie soundtracks). In television commercials, several passages have become  , particularly the opening of  '   (made famous in the film  ) and the opening section \" \" of  's  ; other examples include the \" \" from the    ,  's \" \" from  , the opening bars of  's  ,  's \" \",  's \" \" from  ,  's \" \", and excerpts of  's  .  Several works from the   matched the action to classical music. Notable examples are  's  ,  's  , and  '   and  \n Similarly, movies and television often use standard, clichéd excerpts of classical music to convey refinement or opulence: some of the most-often heard pieces in this category include  's  ,  's  ,  's  ,  's   (as orchestrated by Rimsky-Korsakov), and  's \" \". Shawn Vancour argues the commercialization of classical music in the 1920s may have harmed the  . \n During the 1990s, several research papers and popular books wrote on what came to be called the \" \": an observed temporary, small elevation of scores on   tests as a result of listening to Mozart's music. The approach has been popularized in a book by Don Campbell, and is based on an experiment published in   suggesting that listening to Mozart temporarily boosted students'   by 8 to 9 points.  This popularized version of the theory was expressed succinctly by the   music columnist  : \"researchers... have determined that listening to Mozart actually makes you smarter.\"  Promoters marketed CDs claimed to induce the effect. Florida passed a law requiring toddlers in state-run schools to listen to classical music every day, and in 1998 the governor of Georgia budgeted $105,000 per year to provide every child born in Georgia with a tape or CD of classical music. One of the co-authors of the original studies of the Mozart effect commented \"I don't think it can hurt. I'm all for exposing children to wonderful cultural experiences. But I do think the money could be better spent on   programs.\" \n"},

The board's decisions are based on recommendations of an   (AffCom), composed of Wikimedia community members, which reports regularly to the board. The Affiliations Committee directly approves the recognition of unincorporated user groups. Affiliates are formally recognized by the Wikimedia Foundation, but are independent of it, with no legal control of or responsibility for Wikimedia projects and their content. \n The Foundation began recognizing chapters in 2004.

It is not a private foundation, and contributions to it qualify as tax-deductible charitable contributions.  In 2007, 2008 and 2009,   gave Wikimedia an overall rating of four out of four possible stars,  increased from three to four stars in 2010.  As of January 2020 , the rating was still four stars (overall score 98.14 out of 100), based on data from FY2018. \n The Foundation also increases its revenue through  , sponsorship, services and brand merchandising. The Wikimedia   update feed service, targeted primarily at search engines and similar bulk analysis and republishing, was a source of revenue for a number of years.    was given access to this feed free of charge.  An expanded version of data feeds and content services was launched in 2021 as Wikimedia Enterprise, an LLC subsidiary of the Foundation. \n In July 2014, the Foundation announced it would accept   donations.  In 2021,   accounted for just 0.08% of all donations  and on May 1, 2022, the Foundation stopped accepting cryptocurrency donations, following a   vote. \n The Foundation's net assets grew from an initial $57,000 at the end of its first fiscal year, ending June 30, 2004,  to $53.5 million in mid-2014  and $231 million (plus a $100 million endowment) by the end of June 2021; that year, the Foundation also announced plans to launch Wikimedia Enterprise, to let large organizations pay by volume for high-volume access to otherwise rate-limited APIs. \n In 2020, the Foundation donated $4.5 million to   to create a \"Knowledge Equity Fund\", to provide grants to organizations whose work would not otherwise be covered by Wikimedia grants but addresses racial inequities in accessing and contributing to free knowledge resources. \n In January 2016, the Foundation announced the creation of an   to safeguard its future.  The Wikimedia Endowment was established as a donor-advised fund at the  , with a stated goal to raise $100 million in the next 10 years.    was one of the initial donors, giving $1 million.    and his wife,  , donated $5 million to it in 2017. \n In 2018, major donations to the endowment were received from   and   ($1 million each) and   ($2 million).  In 2019, donations included $2 million from Google,  $3.5 million more from Baldwin and Rausing,  $2.5 million more from Newmark,  and another $1 million from Amazon in October 2019 and again in September 2020. \n As of 2023,  the advisory board consists of  ,  , former Wikimedia Foundation Trustees   and  , former Wikimedia Foundation Board Visitor   of the  , investor  , venture capitalist Michael Kim, portfolio manager Alexander M. Farman-Farmaian, and strategist Lisa Lewin. \n The Foundation itself has provided annual grants of $5 million to its Endowment since 2016.  These amounts have been recorded as part of the Foundation's \"awards and grants\" expenses.  In September 2021, the Foundation announced that the Wikimedia Endowment had reached its initial $100 million fundraising goal in June 2021, five years ahead of its initial target.  In January 2024, the endowment was reported to have a value of $140 million. \n The Foundation summarizes its assets in the \"Statements of Activities\" in its audited reports. These do not include funds in the Wikimedia Endowment, however expenses from the 2015–16 financial year onward include payments to the Wikimedia Endowment. \n A   of Wikimedia Foundation expenses are salaries and wages, followed by community and affiliate grants, contributions to the endowment, and other professional operating expenses and services. \n The Wikimedia Foundation has received a steady stream of grants from other foundations throughout its history.\nIn 2008, the Foundation received a $40,000 grant from the   to create a printable version of Wikipedia.  It also received a $262,000 grant from the   to purchase  ,  a $500,000 unrestricted grant from   and  ,  who later that year joined the Foundation advisory board,  and $177,376 from the historians   and   ( ), among others.  In March 2008, the Foundation announced what was then its largest donation yet: a three-year, $3 million grant from the  . \n In 2009, the Foundation received four grants. The first was a $890,000 Stanton Foundation grant to help study and simplify the user interface for first-time authors of Wikipedia.  The second was a $300,000   grant in July 2009 for  , to improve the interface for uploading multimedia files.  In August 2009, the Foundation received a $500,000 grant from The William and Flora  .  Also in August 2009, the   committed up to $2 million over two years to Wikimedia. \n In 2010,   donated $2 million  and the Stanton Foundation granted $1.2 million to fund the Public Policy Initiative, a pilot program for what later became the Wikipedia Education Program (and the spin-off  ). \n In March 2011, the Sloan Foundation authorized another $3 million grant, to be funded over three years, with the first $1 million to come in July 2011 and the remaining $2 million to be funded in August 2012 and 2013. As a donor,   from the Sloan Foundation gained Board Visitor status at the Wikimedia Foundation Board of Trustees.  In August 2011, the Stanton Foundation pledged to fund a $3.6 million grant of which $1.8 million was funded and the remainder was to come in September 2012. As of 2011, this was the largest grant the Wikimedia Foundation had ever received.  In November 2011, the Foundation received a $500,000 donation from the  . \n In 2012, the Foundation was awarded a grant of $1.25 million from   and   through the  , scheduled to be funded in five equal installments from 2012 through 2015. In 2014, the Foundation received the largest single gift in its history, a $5 million unrestricted donation from an anonymous donor supporting $1 million worth of expenses annually for the next five years.  In March 2012, The  , established by the   co-founder and his wife, awarded the Wikimedia Foundation a $449,636 grant to develop  .  This was part of a larger grant, much of which went to Wikimedia Germany, which took on ownership of the development effort. \n Between 2014 and 2015, the Foundation received $500,000 from the Monarch Fund, $100,000 from the Arcadia Fund and an undisclosed amount from the   to support the   initiative. \n In 2015, a grant agreement was reached with the   to build a search engine called the \" \", a project that  .  In 2017, the Sloan Foundation awarded another $3 million grant for a three-year period,  and Google donated another $1.1 million to the Foundation in 2019. \n The following have donated $500,000 or more each (2008–2019, not including gifts to the Wikimedia Endowment; list may be incomplete):\n The Foundation's   supervises the activities of the Foundation. The founding board had three members, to which two community-elected trustees were added. Starting in 2008 it was composed of ten members:\n Over time, the size of the board and details of the selection processes have evolved. As of 2020, the board may have up to 16 trustees: \n In 2015,  , a trustee recently elected to the board by the community,  was removed from his position by a vote of the rest of the board.  This decision generated dispute among members of the Wikipedia community.  Heilman later said that he \"was given the option of resigning [by the Board] over the last few weeks. As a community elected member I see my mandate as coming from the community which elected me and thus declined to do so. I saw such a move as letting down those who elected me.\"  He subsequently added that while on the Board, he had pushed for greater transparency regarding the Wikimedia Foundation's   project and its financing,  and indicated that his attempts to make public the   grant for the engine had been a factor in his dismissal.  Heilman was reelected to the board by the community in 2017. \n In January 2016,   joined the board before stepping down amid community controversy about a \" \" agreement he executed when at  , which violated   and for which the participating companies paid US$415 million in a class action suit on behalf of affected employees. \n As of January 2024, the board comprised six community-and-affiliate-selected trustees (Shani Evenstein Sigalov,  ,  , Victoria Doronina, Mike Peel and Lorenzo Losa);  five Board-appointed trustees (  director  ,  Bahraini human rights activist and blogger  ,  technology officer Luis Bitencourt-Emilio, Nataliia Tymkiv, and financial expert Kathy Collins); and Wales.  Tymkiv chairs the board, with Al Shafei and Sigalov as vice chairs. \n As of March 2024 there are six committees of the Board of Trustees: the Executive Committee (Chair: Nataliia Tymkiv, as the chair of the Board), the Audit Committee (Chair: Kathy Collins, appointed in 2023), the Governance Committee (Chair: Dariusz Jemielniak, appointed in 2021), the Talent and Culture Committee (Chair: Rosie Stephenson-Goodknight, appointed in 2023), the Community Affairs Committee (Chair: Shani Evenstein Sigalov, appointed in 2021), and the Product and Technology Committee (Chair: Lorenzo Losa, appointed in 2023). \n In 2004, the Foundation appointed Tim Starling as developer liaison to help improve the   software, Daniel Mayer as chief financial officer ( ,  , and coordination of fund drives), and   as content partnership coordinator. In May 2005, the Foundation announced seven more official appointments. \n In January 2006, the Foundation created a number of committees, including the Communication Committee, in an attempt to further organize activities somewhat handled by volunteers at that time.  Starling resigned that month to spend more time on his PhD program.\n As of October 4, 2006 , the Foundation had five paid employees:  two programmers, an administrative assistant, a coordinator handling fundraising and grants, and an interim  ,  Brad Patrick, previously the Foundation's  . Patrick ceased his activity as interim director in January 2007 and then resigned from his position as legal counsel, effective April 1, 2007. He was replaced by   who served as general counsel and legal coordinator from July 2007  to 2010.\n In January 2007, Carolyn Doran was named chief operating officer and Sandy Ordonez joined as  .  Doran began working as a part-time bookkeeper in 2006 after being sent by a  . Doran, found to have had a criminal record,  left the Foundation in July 2007 and   was hired as consultant and special advisor; she became the executive director in December 2007.  Florence Devouard cited Doran's departure from the organization as one of the reasons the Foundation took about seven months to release its fiscal 2007 financial audit. \n Danny Wool, officially the grant coordinator and also involved in   and business development, resigned in March 2007. He accused Wales of misusing the Foundation's funds for recreational purposes and said that Wales had his Wikimedia credit card taken away in part because of his spending habits, a claim Wales denied.  In February 2007, the Foundation added a position, chapters coordinator, and hired Delphine Ménard,  who had been occupying the position as a volunteer since August 2005. Cary Bass was hired in March 2007 in the position of volunteer coordinator. In January 2008, the Foundation appointed Veronique Kessler as the new chief financial and operating officer, Kul Wadhwa as head of business development and Jay Walsh as head of communications.\n In March 2013, Gardner announced she would be leaving her position at the Foundation.    was appointed executive director in May 2014;  she resigned in March 2016. Former chief communications officer   (joined Wikimedia in 2014 ) was appointed the interim executive director, a position made permanent in June 2016.  Maher served as   until April 2021  and is credited with building the Foundation   in her tenure. \n As of October 23, 2023,  there were over 700 people working at the Foundation.    was named the incoming CEO in September 2021, and took over that role in January 2022. \n As of July 2022, the WMF has the following department structure: \n A number of disputes have resulted in   while others have not.  Attorney Matt Zimmerman has said, \"Without strong liability protection, it would be difficult for Wikipedia to continue to provide a platform for user-created encyclopedia content.\" \n In December 2011, the Foundation hired Washington, D.C., lobbyist   Government Strategies LLC to lobby  .  At the time of the hire, the Foundation was concerned about a bill known as the  .  The communities were as well, organizing some of the most visible   against the bill on the Internet alongside other popular websites.\n In October 2013, a German court ruled that the Wikimedia Foundation can be held liable for content added to Wikipedia when there has been a specific complaint; otherwise, the Wikimedia Foundation does not check the content Wikipedia publishes and has no duty to do so. \n In June 2014, Bildkonst Upphovsrätt i Sverige filed a copyright infringement lawsuit against  . \n On June 20, 2014, a defamation lawsuit (Law Division civil case No. L-1400-14) involving Wikipedia editors was filed with the Mercer County Superior Court in New Jersey seeking, inter alia, compensatory and punitive damages. \n In a March 10, 2015, op-ed for  , Wales and Tretikov announced the Foundation was filing   against the   and five other government agencies and officials, including  , calling into question its practice of  , which they argued infringed the constitutional rights of the Foundation's readers, editors and staff. They were joined in the suit by eight additional plaintiffs, including   and  .  On October 23, 2015, the   dismissed the suit   on grounds of  . U.S. District Judge   ruled that the plaintiffs could not plausibly prove they were subject to  , and that their argument is \"riddled with assumptions\", \"speculations\" and \"mathematical gymnastics\".  The plaintiffs filed an appeal with the   on February 17, 2016. \n In September 2020, WMF's application to become an observer at the   (WIPO) was blocked after objections from the government of China  over the existence of a Wikimedia Foundation affiliate in  .  In October 2021, WMF's second application was blocked by the government of China for the same reason.  In May 2022, six Wikimedia movement affiliate chapters were blocked from being accredited to WIPO's Standing Committee on Copyright and Related Rights (SCCR) by China, claiming that the chapters were spreading disinformation.  In July 2022, China blocked an application by seven Wikimedia chapters to be accredited as permanent observers to WIPO;  China's position was supported by a number of other countries, including Russia, Pakistan, Iran, Algeria, Zimbabwe and Venezuela. \n In 2014, Jimmy Wales was confronted with allegations that WMF had \"a miserable cost/benefit ratio and for years now has spent millions on software development without producing anything that actually works\". He acknowledged that he had \"been frustrated as well about the endless controversies about the rollout of inadequate software not developed with sufficient community consultation and without proper incremental rollout to catch show-stopping bugs\". \n During the 2015 fundraising campaign, some members of the community voiced their concerns about the fundraising banners. They argued that they were obtrusive and could deceive potential donors by giving the impression that Wikipedia had immediate financial problems, which was not true. The Wikimedia Foundation vowed to improve wording on further fundraising campaigns to avoid these issues.  Despite this, the Foundation has continued to come under criticism for running campaigns seemingly designed to \"make[] its readers feel guilty.\" Such campaigns have additionally been condemned for, in 2021, being run in countries that had been badly affected by the  , such as   and  ,  as well as for sparking fears in   that Wikipedia might be \"dying\".  This is despite the Foundation being in ownership of \"vast money reserves\", in 2021 reaching its 10-year goal of compiling a $100 million endowment fund in only 5 years. \n In February 2017, an op-ed published by  , the  's online newspaper, titled \"Wikipedia has Cancer\",  produced a debate in both the Wikipedian community and the wider public. The author criticized the Wikimedia Foundation for its ever-increasing annual spending, which, he argued, could put the project at financial risk should an unexpected event happen. The author proposed to cap spending, build up the endowment, and restructure the endowment so that WMF cannot dip into the principal when times get bad. \n Knowledge Engine was a   project initiated in 2015 by WMF to locate and display verifiable and trustworthy information on the Internet.  The KE's goal was to be less reliant on traditional search engines. It was funded with a $250,000 grant from the  .  Some perceived the project as a scandal, mainly because it was conceived in secrecy, and the project proposal was even a surprise to some staff, in contrast with a general culture of transparency in the organization and on the projects. Some of the information available to the community was received through leaked documents published by   in 2016.  Following this dispute, Wikimedia Foundation Executive Director   resigned. \n In 2022, in a recent \"personal appeal\" displayed in an advertising banner on Wikipedia, Jimmy Wales, one of the founders, emphasized that \"Wikipedia is not for sale.\" This statement highlights the non-profit nature of the Wikimedia Foundation (WMF), a non-profit organization based in California that owns intellectual property assets, such as the Wikipedia name and branding. However, the WMF does not own or control the global communities that maintain the site. \n In 2022, the WMF announced new recipients for its \"knowledge equity grants\". As of last June, the WMF reported $239 million in net assets. It is expected to raise $174 million in revenue in the 2023.  Despite expenses on the foundation staff's salaries, there's a significant surplus left. To manage these funds, the WMF has created an endowment composed of investments and cash. This is managed not by the WMF but by the  , a charitable organization that channels funds to   causes and campaigns. \n The endowment aims to grow this capital to $130.4 million in the next fiscal year. Some of these funds are allocated to the knowledge equity fund, which provides grants. \n However, there has been some controversy over the administration of the funds. While the Tides Foundation has promised to become a more transparent   organization to reveal how it manages funds, details on expenses and salaries are still lacking seven years later. \n Additionally, the WMF's salary costs have risen from $7 million in 2010/11 to $88 million in 2021/22, yet only 2% of the raised money goes towards hosting costs. \n \n"},

It is popularly known as   because of the \"ticking\" rhythm throughout the second movement.\n Haydn completed the symphony in   or  . He wrote it for the second of his two visits to London. Having heard one of his symphonies played in London with an orchestra of 300-strong, his   Symphony has that large scale grandeur written in it.  On 3 March 1794, the work was premiered with an orchestra of 60 personally gathered by Haydn's colleague and friend  , who also acted as  , in the  , as part of a concert series featuring Haydn's work organized by Salomon; a second performance took place a week later. \n As was generally true for the London symphonies, the response of the audience was very enthusiastic.  The   reported that \"the connoisseurs admit [it] to be his best work.\"  Additionally, the   reported:\n As usual the most delicious part of the entertainment was a new grand Overture [that is, symphony] by HAYDN; the inexhaustible, the wonderful, the sublime HAYDN! The first two movements were encored; and the character that pervaded the whole composition was heartfelt joy. Every new Overture he writes, we fear, till it is heard, he can only repeat himself; and we are every time mistaken. \n The work has always been popular and continues to appear frequently on concert programs and in recordings.  An average performance lasts about 27 minutes.\n It is scored for two  , two  , two  , two  , two  , two  ,   and  .\n The work is in standard four-  form, as follows:\n The opening movement starts with a minor introduction consisting of 23 measures. A rising scale motif opens the Adagio, similar to the opening of the main theme of the Presto, and connects the Adagio to the main movement.  The main theme of the Presto is meant to catch attention — the rising scale motif begins and ends on the dominant, and two broken chords follow — the tonic and the second degree minor, and ends on the tonic.  This phrase also consists of 10 bars, broken into two parts of an odd 1+4 bar distribution. After the main theme, this phrase returns and starts the modulation by the usage of the A diminished chord, leading to E minor, which finally leads to E major, the dominant of A major. The secondary theme has a similar rhythmic pattern, also beginning with scales in the violins but descending this time, but it has more subtlety. A triumphant codetta concludes the exposition. The development begins with the secondary theme motif reoccurring in different instruments in counterpoint, and transitions into the different motifs of the main theme, also playing contrapuntally. The development turns toward conclusion with the secondary theme once more, and ends with a long falling scale. The recapitulation is straightforward, and the triumphant coda finishes this grand movement.  The   said, \"Nothing can be more original than the subject of the first movement, and having found a happy subject, no man knows like Haydn how to produce incessant variety, without once departing from it.\" \n The second movement, from which the symphony gets its name, begins with   strings and bassoons.  Towards the middle of the movement, there is a dark, fierce passage in G minor, followed by Haydnesque humor and finally the clock theme once again.   said, \"Haydn has a gratifying number of different clocks in his shop, offering 'tick-tock' in a happy variety of colors.\" \n In 1793, Haydn had given his employer   an elaborate musical clock, for which he wrote 12 short pieces, one of them being the basis for the third movement.  This movement, a minuet, is one of Haydn's longest.  The trio evokes a bungling village band, with more Haydnesque humor, similar to what   would use in the trio of his  .  Many scholars, publishers, and musicians, not knowing Haydn's humor, would often \"correct\" the trio. \n The finale of the work is a   rondo-sonata.  This means that the main theme and the secondary theme are similar, or in this case, almost identical, and the main theme is played every time a theme ends. Haydn vastly changes the main theme with each occurrence — something that is not done in rondo works. Even the bridges in between themes are similar to the main theme.  Haydn also builds a fugue into the last movement. \n"},
